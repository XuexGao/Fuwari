This article explains how to add emojis to Telegram using the Stickers service, allowing users to add static emoji images. Users must upload PNG or WEBP files, specify a name for the emoji (e.g., "Logo"), and then send them to the Telegram service with the `/newemojipack` command.  The final step involves selecting an emoji that represents the user’s sentiment and posting it. Premium users can also associate this emoji with their nickname.

# Formal commencement.

This text discusses the addition of TG emojis, not stickers!

Prepare a quantity of PNG or WEBP images, each measuring 100x100 pixels.

Please find @Stickers.

Please send `/newemojipack`.

Please send your image(s).

Here are a few options, depending on the nuance you want to convey:  *   **Option 1 (Formal & Direct):** “Please send an emoji that reflects your expression.” *   **Option 2 (Slightly more conversational):** “Could you please send an emoji that captures your mood?” *   **Option 3 (Concise):** “Send an emoji to represent your emotion.”  I’ve chosen Option 1 as it is the most straightforward and professional.
