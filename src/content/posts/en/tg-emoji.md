To add custom emojis in Telegram, upload 100x100 PNG or WEBP images via @Stickers, use `/newemojipack`, name your pack, upload images, assign an emoji, set a pathname, and share the link to add it. Premium users can display the emoji next to their username.

# Formally begin

> This article discusses adding TG emojis, not stickers!!!

Prepare several PNG or WEBP images, 100x100 px.

Then find @Stickers

Send `/newemojipack`

Next, just give it any name; here I'll call it `Logo`

Then send your picture
