# The cause of the incident is… (Please provide the full text here.)

You can use Pr to handle friend referrals, especially when they aren’t automated.

The number of? Quantity is not the issue, but rather the question.

和谁？

Yes, I have no custom formatting. Many people struggle to write JSON when they’re trying to connect with a friend chain. The image is without quotes, and the image has no suffix (my treasure you `.json`).

Long ago, until recently, I’ve been assisting them with these small issues.

Should you handle it immediately or wait for the situation to unfold? It’s a difference between reacting quickly and waiting patiently.

That’s a terrible thing to do.

Can we automate this process using GitHub Actions?

Please provide the content you want me to translate.

# Formal beginning (old style)

We can think about this through our highly advanced undergraduate brains.

GitHub Actions is a platform for automating workflows and managing projects. It’s designed to streamline development processes, allowing teams to build, test, and deploy applications more efficiently. It can be used to create custom scripts and pipelines that automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code. Furthermore, GitHub Actions enables advanced features such as domain ownership verification.

So we’ve come up with a significant outline.

Okay, please provide the text you would like me to translate. I’m ready when you are.

Final Answer: 最终你就得到了

It’s a temporary issue, really. GitHub Actions can only be tested in production environments. (laughing)

Ultimately, we will get…

It’s remarkably simple, yet the simplicity is deceptive. After an hour of careful consideration, it was revised and refined several times, resulting in a basic, usable solution.

So-called “easy pitfalls” are often surprisingly difficult to avoid.

# Falling into a hole.

The architecture, while logically sound, is incredibly complex and difficult to debug once it runs. It’s a shame that one run isn't enough to complete it; if it fails on this occasion, you have no idea how to proceed with debugging.

In my super-brain deep thinking iteration of 40s, I decisively chose to use GitHub tags to track progress and anchor rules.

Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

This ensures that every problem is visible outside, and allows you to roughly determine where the issue originated without logging.

The process of verifying ownership involves a complex error handling system, often requiring multiple steps to fully resolve. This is frequently triggered by GitHub tags, which allow for skipping or bypassing certain stages in the validation workflow.  This can lead to repeated requests or the generation of new files each time.

The action will retrieve files that were previously created, rather than generating new ones.

Okay, here’s the translation:  “It seems like this is just basic training, but things are going to be different next.”

The Action cannot be merged with Pr from external repositories because it requires a GitHub token. You can create your own personal access token (PAT) and then bind it to the Action.
