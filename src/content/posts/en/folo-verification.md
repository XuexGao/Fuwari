First, you need a blog, or a website with an RSS feed.

For example, 2x.nz/rss.xml

Next, click on the authentication at Folo: https://folo.is

A content will pop up, asking you to place it into RSS

The simplest method is to create a new article like I did, paste this text exactly as it is, and then authenticate.
