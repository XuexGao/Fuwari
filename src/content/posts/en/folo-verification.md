# How do I authenticate?

First, you need to have a blog or website with an RSS feed.

比如 2x.nz/rss.xml

Please click on the authentication link at [https://folo.is] in the Follo application.

The system will present you with a content item requiring you to embed it into an RSS feed.

The simplest method is to create a new article and paste the passage directly into it, then verify it.
