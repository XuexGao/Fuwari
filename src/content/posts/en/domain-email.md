The article compares two free domain email services: NetEase Enterprise Mail and Tencent Enterprise Mail. Tencent’s service is recommended for its ease of setup, stability, and straightforward SMTP/IMAP configuration. NetEase, while functional, requires manual permission setup and has a clunkier user experience. The guide provides step-by-step instructions for both, but emphasizes Tencent as the superior choice for users seeking a reliable, hassle-free domain email solution.

# Introduction

The earliest I became aware of domain-based email was by chance, when I saw in a friend's development group that his Microsoft account was linked to an email address: admin@hiswebsite'sdomain.com.

I was very curious at the time, so I asked him, "Is this email address self-hosted?"

Because I also knew at that time that I could build my own email service by purchasing a VPS and pairing it with some open-source mail server frameworks, but this would require financial and time investment, and I thought it wouldn't be very stable, so I never tried it.

Then he said he was using Cloudflare's email forwarding service. But since it's a forwarding service, if you want to send emails using your domain email address, it requires a lot of hassle—it's too fragmented.

Thus, NetEase Free Enterprise Email and Tencent Enterprise Email were discovered, which allow you to bind your domain for use as a domain email, capable of both receiving and sending emails.

# Scheme Comparison

| | NetEase Free Enterprise Email | Tencent Enterprise Email |
|---|---|---|
| Enable SMTP/IMAP | ⭐⭐ Trouble, has pitfalls | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Simple and straightforward |
| Stability | ⭐⭐⭐ Older brand | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Backed by a big company |
| Recommendation Level | Not recommended | Recommended |

# Option 1: Tencent Enterprise Email (Recommended)

## Formally begin

First, enter [](https://work.weixin.qq.com/mail/) to create an enterprise, which will prompt you to bind Enterprise WeChat; just follow the steps to complete it.

Next, bind the domain and add a few MX records.

## Enable SMTP/IMAP/POP3

We need to go to [Tencent Enterprise Email - Login Entry](https://exmail.qq.com/login)

Note, click here `Other login methods`

Then select the account and password to log in

Then select Member Login (skip this step if you are already logged in directly)

![](../../assets/images/2025-05-02-20-59-22-image.webp)

Click Settings in the top left corner next.

# Option Two: NetEase Free Enterprise Email

> Note: NetEase Enterprise Email has some issues; SMTP/IMAP/POP3 are disabled by default. If you want to enable them, a popup will appear saying `Administrator has not enabled current login permissions`, resulting in a poor user experience. It is recommended to use Tencent Enterprise Email instead.

## Create an account and configure the administrator

First, go to [NetEase Free Enterprise Email](https://ym.163.com/) to create an account. Register directly using your phone number.

Please note that after registration, your login username and password will be sent to you via **sms**. Then, proceed to https://mail.qiye.163.com/ to log in.

If you don't like the password randomly generated by the system, you can first click "Forgot Password," then enter your account name and verify the bound phone number to reset the password.

After logging in, it's roughly like this.

If you don't like your account name, such as mine which is **erchashush** @acofork.freeqiye.com, the "erchashush" can actually be changed.

In organizational management, click Account Management and select Create New Account.

![](../../assets/images/a20e7931-c460-4134-b1b0-0fee82f8a7fc.webp)

Then write an alias you want. When binding your phone, enter your own number, as a verification code will be required for the first login; if entered incorrectly, you can simply delete it.

Then we need to elevate privileges for this new account if you want to log in to the backend as superadmin.

![](../../assets/images/6f21feca-984d-444e-b80f-bf1a28e4cf79.webp)

Then click the logout button in the top right corner, and log in using the newly created administrator account.

## Bind your domain

Go to Organization Management - Domain Management - Add Domain

![](../../assets/images/2fa04b72-f0e7-43c0-9c2a-1daab62e67cb.webp)

Configure TXT records and MX records through your domain provider (such as Cloudflare) as instructed.

## Log in to your email account

Go to [NetEase Mail Master - Efficient and Powerful Cross-Platform Email Client](https://dashi.163.com/) to download the corresponding version

Log in with your email and password. If needed, phone verification can be performed. It is recommended to download the NetEase Mail Master app for mobile devices. After logging in via the mobile app, any login on other platforms will require authorization from the mobile app, which is more secure.

## Effect Display

The signature and sender avatar can be set through the NetEase Mail Master app on your phone.
