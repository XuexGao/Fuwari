# Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

I started to realize that domain email addresses were because I saw an email address associated with a Microsoft account on a developer group within a friend’s development team, linking it to the domain com. he had set up at his website.

I was very curious and asked him if his email address is self-hosted.

Because I knew that by purchasing a VPS and combining it with some open email frameworks, it was possible to set up a domain name, but this would require money and time costs, and I considered it unstable.

He uses Cloudflare’s email forwarding service, but because it’s forwarding, you need to incur some extra cost for sending emails with a domain email address. This is quite disruptive.

Netlify Free Business Email and Tencent Enterprise Email can be free-linked your domain as a domain email, allowing you to receive and send emails.
