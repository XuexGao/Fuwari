# Why did I decide to buy a Mac?
First, it’s a common thing – the feeling of freshness, but I’ve also used Mac before. In the New Year, I bought a Mac Mini, but at the time, I didn't see it as a productivity tool, just as a home server to use. I used it for a few days and discovered several issues: firstly, Mac doesn’t seem common for servers, and many things that can be deployed directly on Linux are difficult to set up in macOS; secondly, my NAS load service wasn't very high, mainly consisting of a QQBot, so there was no need to buy an expensive piece of art to use it as a home server.

This was a completely unexpected purchase. The fuse was triggered by a late-night gaming session with a friend, which went on for an entire night and then devolved into a frustrating battle. Furthermore, my friend was notoriously clumsy, and the resulting punishment was particularly intense. As fate would have it, I woke up at 4:00 AM on the following day, completely unprepared, and immediately bought a Mac.

I found that during my six months of studying, I didn’t rely on games. During those six months, I used the most software to be **Trae**. I worked on building wheels, making toys, writing Serverless programs, decorating websites, and just doing videos occasionally. Games weren't said to be a one-time thing, and there were some weeks where I played games every day. However, overall, gaming occupied a small amount of free time, and most situations involved friends playing together. I don’t know when I formed this idea, it might have come during the period when ChatGPT 3.5 was released. I just thought that if I took my gaming time to write code and build websites, it would be beneficial for my learning and would make future studies easier. On the other hand, it's not about wanting to play games all the time, and also thinking carefully about what can be achieved with a single game session. A level? What is there to gain from playing one day? Can it earn money? Even a day of leveling up could result in a negative growth; conversely, writing one line of code or tinkering with a website could yield valuable technical experience, and I could share my knowledge with others, such as writing articles and making videos. On the other hand, there’s also a reason for this – **开学** – talking about off-topic things, although I'm in a large university, it's only 20km away, and the dorm environment was very bad when I first arrived. Although it's not far from home, going to class every day is quite difficult during this time. Even though there’s no overnight stay, the situation is somewhat pessimistic because of the tight schedule of classes in a new semester. Despite the absence of overnight stays, the situation is slightly less optimistic because of the close timing of classes during the first semester. Although the walk-up period doesn't require accommodation, as the saying goes, humans cannot be separated from mobile phones, networks, and electricity. However, we are studying computer science, and I myself have already gotten involved in this field. So, **笔记本电脑** needs to be brought to school-home every day. Someone said that there is no server room at the school. Of course, there is, it’s high-performance, and bringing a laptop for other students' use might be on a whole day of classes; while my usage is very different. Based on what I mentioned earlier, I don’t need to play games all the time, the computer is more like a project management tool for me – I use it with them: like VSC (Trae) writing code, GitHub submitting code, Obsidian writing articles, OBS recording videos, and editing them; I can post videos or do other things on the browser. These things were all available during the holiday period in the past, when it was possible to do them all day long – for example, at 8:00 AM waking up, ordering takeout, then looking at yesterday's code, fixing it until after dinner, and then going to sleep. Overall, my midday time during those days of school wasn’t looking for some small games, but rather watching videos. There was a feeling that I could do something useful but because I didn’t have tools, I couldn’t do anything. According to my assessment, **太诡异了** all the walk-up students are so weird, and I'm taking their life for my own benefit. They're looking at my life for you to see your strange operation. So, I bought this Mac and turned it over (don’t ask me why I turned it over – it’s because of the advertising spread everywhere, and also because I used to use platforms like RecycleNow and Zhihu before). About why I turned in the old Winbook, this reason is very simple – if this Winbook still existed, how would it collaborate with the new one? And there's no such strong demand for Mac. Simply put, it’s better to stop using it now, and it’s better to use it again later.
# Mac vs. Win differences?
Light. This MacBook Air M4 weighs only 1.24 kg, compared to the previous Win book (Mechanical Revolution X) which was marked at 2.2 kg (I think it’s not that heavy), and can be lifted by one hand, even placed in a bag – I feel like it doesn't weigh much more than books.
This is primarily because I purchased an Air, it’s 13-inch, and while smaller than my previous Win laptop (I won't use the embedded display on my Win laptop for most situations, as it’s mainly used for connecting external displays), the high-quality 2K IPS screen delivers incredibly sharp visuals.

续航长。这个真的没得黑，得益于Apple现在将Mac的CPU全部替换为了Arm架构的自研芯片M系列，续航真的很长，一般一台Win本拔电几小时电量可能就掉完了，但是Mac早上充满电，带去出勤上班上学不插电真的是妥妥用一天（当然，你不能用一些高功耗软件），我这台Mac标称的续航是18h，我觉得已经完全够用了
# Mac的特色？
系统。我觉得Mac的系统，也就是macOS在Linux和Windows之间。它既不是Linux（如：Debian）那样的毛坯房，也不是Windows的那种啥都能干。在Mac上，如果你打开终端，你会发现很多操作特别像Linux和Windows，比如Mac有AppStore，对标Windows的Microsoft Store，但是Mac还有brew，就像Debian Linux的apt包管理器（同时也像Windows的第三方包管理器Scoop。当然，Scoop还是效仿apt等Linux包管理器，而不是对标Mac）比如你想安装 **NodeJS** ，只需要先把 `brew` 装上，然后终端运行 `brew install nodejs` 即可

权限管理。在Mac上，软件安装后很类似安卓的“沙盒”机制，所有越权访问都需要用户的授权，你可能会说，这在现代操作系统上不是基本功吗。但是，如果你用过Windows的QQ你就会知道，一旦QQ安装完毕，当你把QQ最小化到托盘后，如果有新通知，那么QQ立马会调用Windows的通知API向你发送一条通知。但是在Mac上不是这样，在QQ安装完毕后，系统会提示该软件需要使用通知权限，点进这个系统通知后，你会被导航到设置-通知，此时，你能看到QQ的通知权限是关的，你必须手动将其打开，该软件才能在后续给你推送通知，否则，这将是有关于QQ的最后一次通知

生态。有人说，Mac有什么生态，封闭的要死，是死是活都要看Apple脸色。确实，App Store的审核及其严格，我目前安装的大部分软件都并未上架到AppStore，但是，这并不代表Mac上软件生态烂。在Mac上，安装软件有三种方式，1.AppStore 2.浏览器下载 `.dmg` 文件，双机后拖放到应用程序文件夹 3.浏览器下载 `.pkg` 文件，双击后会弹出安装向导，一路下一步即可完成安装。绝大多数软件都是使用后两种方式安装的，其实主要还是AppStore上的软件要交苹果开发者税，而第三方侧载就不用考虑这么多了。当然，毕竟换了一个系统，对于小开发者做的开源软件，可能并没有给Mac打包一个预构建的文件，这就需要你拉源码来自己编译运行了，比如 `https://github.com/WEIFENG2333/VideoCaptioner` ，这有时候也是好事，能帮助你了解软件开发、构建与发布

# Mac的快速上手
安装Brew（类似Debian Linux的apt高级软件包管理器）。安装完毕后即可用 `brew install python` 来安装各个软件包了
```bash
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/cunkai/HomebrewCN/raw/master/Homebrew.sh)"
```
Mac默认的Python3.9，太老了，使用brew可以安装最新版的Python，但是并不会替换环境变量，需要使用Brew的链接命令替换默认环境变量。之后重启终端即可
*在正规开发环境应当使用Anaconda或者Poetry等版本控制/虚拟环境软件来管理，盲目升级Python版本可能会造成一些系统问题*
```bash
brew link python@3.13 --force
```

JB系列软件一件激活
```bash
curl -L -o ckey.run ckey.run && bash ckey.run
```
