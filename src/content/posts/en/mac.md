title: "Why do I need to buy a Mac?"
description: "Here’s the translation:  The advantages of Mac are: portability, extended battery life, and high performance. However, it is expensive, requiring a new learning curve for a different operating system. From my personal perspective, I believe switching from Windows to Mac was a sound decision."

# Why did I decide to purchase a Mac?
Firstly, it’s a common experience: the desire for novelty versus practical use. While I've used Mac in the past, particularly during the holidays when I purchased a MacMini for home use, it wasn’t initially conceived as a productivity tool. Instead, it served primarily as a family server. After a few days of usage, several issues arose – firstly, Mac servers are uncommon and often require significant configuration on Linux; secondly, my existing NAS system simply doesn't handle the volume of traffic needed for services like 1Panel, which necessitates a substantial investment in an art piece rather than a practical solution.

Following a period of intense gaming with a friend, the purchase of a Mac was unexpectedly motivated. The cord malfunctioned due to an all-night session, exacerbated by his friend’s poor game skills and subsequent frustration. Furthermore, the day's schedule included a morning class at 8:00 AM, necessitating immediate action upon waking up. Consequently, I found myself jolted awake at 4:00 AM, a jarring transition that led to the purchase of a Mac as a last-minute solution.

Here’s a professional English translation of the text, adhering to your instructions:  “The reason behind this is that I found that during my six months at university, I didn't rely on gaming. During my time at university, I primarily used **Trae** software for creating props, toys, and serverless programming, using it daily to build wheels, make small toys, write server-side code, decorate websites, and watch videos occasionally. Gaming wasn’t about simply playing a game once or twice; there were also several weeks where I played games every day. However, overall, the time spent gaming was not a significant portion of my total idle time, and most of it was spent with friends. I don't know when this developed a mindset; it might have started during the period when ChatGPT 3.5 was released. I felt that if I had used the time spent gaming to write code and build websites, it would be beneficial for my learning and ultimately make future studies easier. On the other hand, it’s not just about wanting to play games; it's also about thinking critically – how much can one game actually accomplish? What are the benefits of a day spent playing? Can it earn money? Even a day spent playing a ranked position could result in a negative growth rate; conversely, writing a day’s code or tinkering with a website could yield valuable technical experience and knowledge. Furthermore, there's a significant reason for this – **start_school**. I’ve been studying at a large university, only 20 kilometers away, and the dorm environment was quite bad from the start. The dormitory supervisor announced that we could take a leave of absence on the first day, and I promptly arranged it. Although the distance is relatively short, traveling to and from school takes an hour each way – one hour to get there and one hour back. Despite the fact that time isn’t long, in the new semester's curriculum, the situation has become somewhat precarious. Even though a leave of absence doesn’t require accommodation or living expenses, the saying goes that humans cannot be separated from their mobile phones, internet, and electricity. However, we are studying computer science, and I myself have already explored this field. So, **laptop** needs to be brought to school-home every day. Some people say that our school doesn’t have a server room. Of course, it does, and the performance is excellent, and bringing a desktop computer for other students would be a full day of classes; while my usage is completely different. Based on what I mentioned earlier, I spend most of my lunch time at school, which isn't playing games to find some small things but rather just watching videos. There’s a feeling that there could be more to do, but because I don’t have the tools, I’m powerless. According to my assessment, **too_strange**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_strange) the soft bed, combined with the inherent heat of a gaming laptop, causes pain and numbness in my legs, so I don't want to carry this two-headed burden. It’s also uncomfortable to lie on the floor (the knees ache and it’s itchy). However, there’s something about the Win system – it weighs around 2-3 kilograms, and the fan of a gaming laptop is extremely hot, so I don't want to carry this two-headed burden. It’s also because I am not comfortable with sleeping, so I have to lie on the table (the back hurts my legs). But then, considering the fact that I’m taking a walk-only course, without a bed, if I wanted to sleep, I would have to lie on the desk (the back is uncomfortable and itchy). However, speaking of this, Win systems weigh around 2-3 kg, and gaming laptops have a fan that makes them very hot. I don’t want to carry this two-headed burden – it's a problem for my DNA. It’s also because I wanted to get this Mac, and **old_win_laptop** was transferred to the computer (don’t ask me why I transferred it, it’s partly due to advertising hype and partly because I used platforms like RecycleNow and eBay in the past. This time, I want to switch to a different platform). Regarding why I sold the old Win laptop, this is actually quite simple – if that Win laptop was still active, how would I collaborate with it? And how about the lack of strong demand for Mac’s needs. Simply put, it's better to stop using it and start using something new.”
# Mac and Windows differ in several key aspects. While both are operating systems, they have distinct design philosophies, user interfaces, and feature sets. Mac is known for its intuitive and streamlined experience, emphasizing a focus on aesthetics and ease of use. Windows, conversely, often prioritizes functionality and customization, offering a wider range of options and a more traditional interface. Ultimately, the best choice depends on individual preferences and workflow needs.
The MacBook Air M4 weighs only 1.24 kg, significantly lighter than the previous Winbook (Mechanical Revolution X) which was advertised as 2.2 kg. It’s easily manageable by one hand and can be carried in a bag – even feeling like it doesn't add much weight to my belongings.
Here’s the translation:  “This is primarily due to the fact that I purchased an Air device, which is 13-inch. While it's smaller than my previous Win laptop in terms of internal display capabilities – I rarely use Win laptops with embedded displays, relying instead on external monitors – the Apple’s high-quality 2K IPS screen delivers exceptionally sharp and detailed visuals.”

续航长。这个真的没得黑，得益于Apple现在将Mac的CPU全部替换为了Arm架构的自研芯片M系列，续航真的很长，一般一台Win本拔电几小时电量可能就掉完了，但是Mac早上充满电，带去出勤上班上学不插电真的是妥妥用一天（当然，你不能用一些高功耗软件），我这台Mac标称的续航是18h，我觉得已经完全够用了
# Mac的特色？
系统。我觉得Mac的系统，也就是macOS在Linux和Windows之间。它既不是Linux（如：Debian）那样的毛坯房，也不是Windows的那种啥都能干。在Mac上，如果你打开终端，你会发现很多操作特别像Linux和Windows，比如Mac有AppStore，对标Windows的Microsoft Store，但是Mac还有brew，就像Debian Linux的apt包管理器（同时也像Windows的第三方包管理器Scoop。当然，Scoop还是效仿apt等Linux包管理器，而不是对标Mac）比如你想安装 **NodeJS** ，只需要先把 `brew` 装上，然后终端运行 `brew install nodejs` 即可

权限管理。在Mac上，软件安装后很类似安卓的“沙盒”机制，所有越权访问都需要用户的授权，你可能会说，这在现代操作系统上不是基本功吗。但是，如果你用过Windows的QQ你就会知道，一旦QQ安装完毕，当你把QQ最小化到托盘后，如果有新通知，那么QQ立马会调用Windows的通知API向你发送一条通知。但是在Mac上不是这样，在QQ安装完毕后，系统会提示该软件需要使用通知权限，点进这个系统通知后，你会被导航到设置-通知，此时，你能看到QQ的通知权限是关的，你必须手动将其打开，该软件才能在后续给你推送通知，否则，这将是有关于QQ的最后一次通知

生态。有人说，Mac有什么生态，封闭的要死，是死是活都要看Apple脸色。确实，App Store的审核及其严格，我目前安装的大部分软件都并未上架到AppStore，但是，这并不代表Mac上软件生态烂。在Mac上，安装软件有三种方式，1.AppStore 2.浏览器下载 `.dmg` 文件，双机后拖放到应用程序文件夹 3.浏览器下载 `.pkg` 文件，双击后会弹出安装向导，一路下一步即可完成安装。绝大多数软件都是使用后两种方式安装的，其实主要还是AppStore上的软件要交苹果开发者税，而第三方侧载就不用考虑这么多了。当然，毕竟换了一个系统，对于小开发者做的开源软件，可能并没有给Mac打包一个预构建的文件，这就需要你拉源码来自己编译运行了，比如 `https://github.com/WEIFENG2333/VideoCaptioner` ，这有时候也是好事，能帮助你了解软件开发、构建与发布

# Mac的快速上手
安装Brew（类似Debian Linux的apt高级软件包管理器）。安装完毕后即可用 `brew install python` 来安装各个软件包了
```bash
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/cunkai/HomebrewCN/raw/master/Homebrew.sh)"
```
Mac默认的Python3.9，太老了，使用brew可以安装最新版的Python，但是并不会替换环境变量，需要使用Brew的链接命令替换默认环境变量。之后重启终端即可
*在正规开发环境应当使用Anaconda或者Poetry等版本控制/虚拟环境软件来管理，盲目升级Python版本可能会造成一些系统问题*
```bash
brew link python@3.13 --force
```

JB系列软件一件激活
```bash
curl -L -o ckey.run ckey.run && bash ckey.run
```
