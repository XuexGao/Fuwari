The author decided to buy a Mac not for server use but as a personal productivity tool, driven by a desire to replace a heavy Windows laptop with a lighter, longer-lasting, and more developer-friendly machine. They appreciate macOS’s Unix-like terminal, sandboxed app permissions, and flexible software installation methods, despite its closed ecosystem. The Mac’s portability, battery life, and ecosystem suit their needs as a computer science student who values coding, content creation, and efficient workflow over gaming.

# Why I Decided to Buy a Mac
First, it's the usual talking point: novelty. But I haven't been without using Macs—I bought a Mac Mini during the New Year, but at that time, I didn't intend to use it as a productivity tool; rather, I treated it as a home server. After using it for a few days, I noticed several issues: first, Macs aren't commonly used as servers, and many things that can be easily deployed on Linux—such as the 1Panel dashboard—require manual configuration on Mac; second, my NAS already has minimal service loads, basically just a QQBot, so there's no need to spend over 3,000 yuan on an "art piece" to serve as a home server.

Then it came to why I bought another Mac this time—the reason is actually a bit absurd. The trigger was one day when I played games all night with a friend, staying up until the early hours. Since my friend was not very skilled, the game was quite frustrating, and I had an 8 a.m. class the next day. I ended up waking up at 4 a.m., and naturally, I was completely dazed all day the next day. When I got home the next day, I thought, **I have never felt happy playing games before**, and in a fit of anger, I used my coming-of-age money to buy a Mac...

根本原因是，我发现居家的这6个月我并不依赖游戏，在居家的那段时间，我用最多的软件应该是 **Trae** ，天天用它造轮子，造小玩具，写Serverless程序，给网站装饰装饰，没事就再做做视频拿点外快。游戏并不是说一次没玩过，也有个别几周天天game。但总体来说打游戏占总空闲时间的占比不高，并且大部分情况都是朋友拉我玩。我也不知道在什么时候形成了一个观念，可能是ChatGPT 3.5出来的那段时间吧，就觉得，我如果把打游戏的时间拿来写写代码折腾折腾网站，这件事既是我喜爱做的，又能提升我的知识水平，以后的学习也就更容易。而打游戏，一不是我自发性的想打，二是仔细想想，打一天游戏能获得什么？段位？有什么用？能换钱吗？甚至打一天段位还会负增长；反过来想，写一天代码或者说折腾一天网站能获得什么？能获得技术经验，能丰富知识储备，然后我还可以把我懂的我理解的知识分享给大家，比如写文章做视频，有时候顺便还能拿点小钱。另外一方面点原因就是 **开学** ，讲点题外话吧，虽然我上的是大专院校，但是离家并不远，仅20km左右，并且入校第一天我就觉得宿舍环境太差，然后导员在当天也公布了可以办走读的消息，我遂在2天后就办了走读。虽说离家并不远，但是一趟去程也要个1小时，回程又要个1小时。虽说时间并不长，但是在大一新生的课程紧密的情况下，情况就有点不乐观了。尽管走读生不需要住宿，也就是不需要将被子啊生活用品啊带到学校来，但是俗话说，现代人类不能离身的有三个东西，移动电话、网络、电。但是我们学的是计算机专业，而我本人也早就涉猎了这个专业，那么 **笔记本电脑** 要在学校-家来回跑是必不可少的。有人就说，你们学校没有机房吗？当然有，性能还不差，自备电脑对于其他同学的应用场景可能是上了一天课了，回寝室跟舍友开黑打游戏；而对我的使用场景就截然不同了，根据上文提到的，我对打游戏并不是刚需，电脑对于我来说更像是一个项目操控工具，我用电脑就是跟他们打交道：比如VSC（Trae）写代码、Github提交代码、黑曜石（Obsidian）写文章、OBS录视频、剪映剪视频，浏览器发视频或者干点别的。这些事情本来在放假那段时间是全天都可以干的，比如早上8点醒了，点个外卖，然后开电脑看看QQ聊聊天，中午吃个饭开始看看昨天写的代码，修修补补到晚上，再吃个饭然后睡觉，整体的时间是非常灵活的。但是，开学后，由于每天的课是在不同的时间上，有可能上个早八，让你休息3小时再上下午的课，那么这个三小时干什么呢？有人会说，午休啊，睡个觉不爽吗，而我的评价是，**太诡异了** 都走读生了，晚上最早4点到家最晚11点到家，那么软那么大的床，倒头就睡睡足8小时然后再上下一个早八，你还能困吗？而且因为我是走读，我是没有床铺的，如果想要睡觉，要不趴桌子上（腰疼腿麻），要不躺地上（挡人走路而且硌得慌）。但是话又说回来了，Win本动辄2-3kg的重量加上游戏本特有的风扇吵机体烫，我是不想带这个活爹两头跑的，它就好好的在家伪装台式机就好了。综上，在那段时间我的在校中午时间，不是找点小游戏，就是刷视频，有一种感觉能干点什么事但是又因为没有工具所以无能为力。根据种种原因，再加上那天那几个b真的是太菜了，我在拿生命提你的分，你在拿我的生命给我看你的唐人操作。所以，我入手了这台Mac，并且 **将旧Win本** 扔转转上了（别问我为什么扔转转，一是因为广告铺天盖地的已经刻进DNA了，二是曾经用过爱回收和闲鱼等平台，这次想换个平台了）。关于为什么要把旧Win本卖了，这个原因其实非常简单，因为如果这个Win本还在，一是双机到底要如何协作？二是Mac的刚需没这么强。简单来说就是旧的不去，新的不来
# What are the differences between Mac and Windows?
Light. My MacBook Air M4 weighs only 1.24kg, compared to the previous Windows laptop (Mechrevo Aurora X), which is advertised as 2.2kg (I think it's not that light). The Mac is light enough to be picked up with one hand, and even when placed in a bag, it feels lighter than a book.
Small. This is mainly because I bought the Air, which is 13 inches. Although it's smaller than my previous Windows laptop (most of the time, I don't use the built-in display of the Windows laptop; I use an external monitor), thanks to Apple's high-color-accuracy 2K screen, the display quality remains very crisp.

Long battery life. There's truly nothing to criticize here, thanks to Apple now replacing all Mac CPUs with its own custom Arm-based M series chips, resulting in genuinely long battery life. Generally, a Windows laptop might lose its charge within a few hours when unplugged, but my Mac, after being fully charged in the morning, can easily last all day without being plugged in—whether for work, school, or commuting (of course, you can't run high-power software). My Mac is rated for 18 hours of battery life, and I find that more than sufficient.
# What are the features of Mac?
System. I think macOS, the system for Mac, sits somewhere between Linux and Windows. It’s neither the bare-bones house like Debian Linux nor the all-purpose system like Windows. On a Mac, if you open the Terminal, you’ll find many operations resemble those of Linux and Windows. For example, Mac has the App Store, which corresponds to Microsoft Store on Windows. But Mac also has Homebrew, similar to Debian Linux’s apt package manager (and also akin to Windows’ third-party package manager Scoop). Of course, Scoop still emulates Linux package managers like apt rather than directly competing with Mac. If you want to install **NodeJS**, you just need to first install `brew`, then run `brew install nodejs` in the Terminal.

Permission Management. On Mac, after software installation, it is similar to Android's "sandbox" mechanism, where any privileged access requires user authorization. You might say, isn't this a basic feature of modern operating systems? But if you've used QQ on Windows, you'll know that once QQ is installed, when you minimize QQ to the system tray, if there's a new notification, QQ immediately calls the Windows notification API to send you a notification. However, on Mac, this is not the case. After QQ is installed, the system will prompt that the application requires notification permissions. Clicking on this system notification will navigate you to Settings > Notifications, where you’ll see that QQ’s notification permission is turned off. You must manually enable it for the application to send you notifications afterward; otherwise, this will be the last notification QQ sends you.

Ecosystem. Some people say Mac has no ecosystem—it’s closed and rigid, and whether it lives or dies depends entirely on Apple. Indeed, the App Store’s review process is extremely strict; most of the software I’ve installed so far is not available on the App Store. But this doesn’t mean the Mac software ecosystem is bad. On Mac, there are three ways to install software: 1. App Store, 2. Download a `.dmg` file via browser, mount it, and drag the application into the Applications folder, 3. Download a `.pkg` file via browser, double-click it to launch an installer, and follow the prompts to complete installation. Most software is installed using the latter two methods. The main reason is that apps on the App Store must pay Apple’s developer fee, whereas sideloading third-party apps avoids this cost. Of course, since you’re switching to a different system, open-source software created by small developers may not have pre-built binaries for Mac—you’ll need to clone the source code and compile it yourself, such as `https://github.com/WEIFENG2333/VideoCaptioner`. Sometimes this is actually beneficial, as it helps you understand software development, building, and distribution.

# Mac Quick Start Guide
Install Brew (a high-level package manager similar to Debian Linux's apt). After installation, you can use `brew install python` to install various packages.
```bash
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/cunkai/HomebrewCN/raw/master/Homebrew.sh)"
```
Mac's default Python 3.9 is too old. You can install the latest version of Python using brew, but it won't replace the environment variables. You need to use Brew's link command to replace the default environment variables. After that, restart the terminal.
*n a formal development environment, it is recommended to use version control or virtual environment tools such as Anaconda or Poetry for management; blindly upgrading the Python version may cause certain system issues*
```bash
brew link python@3.13 --force
```

JB series software one activation
```bash
curl -L -o ckey.run ckey.run && bash ckey.run
```
