Umami Cloud offers a tutorial for setting up and using Umami, allowing users to self-host the service. The initial steps involve registering on the platform via a sign-up link, which can be found at https://umami.is/ (if not accessible, please check for ad blocking).  Users then complete the registration process by submitting required information through a form. These forms include an email verification request and a login process utilizing a validation code. The user is prompted to select a region – either US-based statistics or EU-based statistics – based on their preference.  The user can then configure website tracking codes within the `<head>` section of their website, inserting them into the HTML. Finally, Umami Cloud provides a view of website traffic after enabling sharing URLs.

# 注意事项

Umami Cloud’s free user limit of three sites.

The monthly event count is 10,000, and I’m building a blog to accommodate it. You can find the tutorial on my b-station – no, I don’t want to be contacted for anything.
