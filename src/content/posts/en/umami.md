Region selection is arbitrary (choosing the United States means your statistical data will be stored on servers in the United States; choosing the EU means your statistical data will be stored on servers in the EU).

It is recommended to enable the Share URL setting in your settings, so your users can see your site's traffic in real time.

# [[X:content]]

Umami Cloud limits free users to 3 sites.

The free version allows 100,000 events per month, but I feel that's not enough for my blog, so I've already set up my own. You can check out my tutorial on Bilibili; if there's nothing, it just means I haven't posted it yet ~~come and pester me~~
