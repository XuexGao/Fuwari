I stumbled upon a mysterious blog that caught my interest, so I donated 100 CNY. The blog’s eye-catching cover and smooth writing drew me in, and I ended up reading several posts. I also found it amusing that the author removed JavaScript entirely—something a friend of mine often claims HTML forms can replace, which resonated with me.

Today, I stumbled upon a mysterious blog, which was quite interesting, so I donated 100 CNY.

As for how I found this blog?

Please watch the VCR.

Then I discovered this treasure blog.

Maybe it's because the cover image is more attractive, or because the article content flows smoothly and is richly detailed?

I don't know, anyway, I kept looking down.

I have read quite a few over time.

Then I found that the author had completely removed JavaScript in the current version ~~ I have a friend who keeps saying HTML forms can replace JS ~~

It also sparked some resonance.

Emotionally and logically, we should all support this.

That’s it. I don’t know what else to write. I’m someone who prefers to be straightforward—I can’t get any more poetic.
