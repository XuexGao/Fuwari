Error message indicates a mismatch between the provided GitHub payment information name and the document name submitted. If these names are not identical, you must delete your account and re-login to Github after making the changes.

Error occurred due to VPN or incorrect location. Please ensure you are using a mainland China network connection. If you do not have campus Wi-Fi, use data!
