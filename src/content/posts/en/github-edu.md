This guide walks students through GitHub’s student verification process using documents like admission letters, followed by claiming free domain benefits (e.g., .tech, .me) via the GitHub Student Developer Pack. It emphasizes using Chinese networks, translating documents if needed, and updating payment info with correct names. After approval, users can redeem domains by linking GitHub accounts, adding them to carts, and configuring DNS via Cloudflare for activation.

Make sure you are a student

And possess one of the following: **student ID, admission letter, graduation certificate** (I used the admission letter)

First, go to [Payment Information](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information) to ensure that the information you provide is accurate and that your name is entered in pinyin.

If not, make the changes and **be sure to re-login to GitHub!**

## Troubleshooting Certification

The error says the name does not match. Ensure that the name in your GitHub Payment Information matches the name on your submitted proof documents. If they don’t match, after making the change, you must log out and log back into GitHub.

Error: VPN used or location incorrect. Please ensure you are using a network within mainland China! If you don't have a campus network, use your mobile data!
