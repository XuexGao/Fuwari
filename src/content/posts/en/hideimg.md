This article describes a technique called "Experience Site" that creates an image by subtly altering the brightness of hidden images within an original picture. The process involves embedding the original image and then reducing its luminance, arranging it in a grid pattern, and finally rendering it as a grayscale net.  Exposure increases the original image's brightness, while the hidden images are revealed as white, effectively obscuring the details of both layers.

# The core principle.

First, embed the original image. Subsequently, reduce the brightness of the hidden image to a very low level and arrange it in a chessboard pattern.

The final image exhibits a grainy, grid-like pattern.

The default view is limited to the original image, although the hidden information remains visible, but it’s too dark; human eyes will treat them as black pixels.

When enhancing visibility, the original image became overexposed, resulting in a predominantly white appearance and loss of detail.

The hidden image is now revealed, gradually becoming visible.

The final image has vanished, while the hidden image now fully reveals itself.
