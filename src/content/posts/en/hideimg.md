This article describes a technique called "Experience Site" that creates a unique visual effect by subtly darkening and arranging hidden images within a video. The process involves lowering the brightness of the original image, embedding it in a grid pattern, and then revealing the hidden images as grayscale, effectively blurring the lines between the two.

# Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

First, embed the image and reduce its brightness to a very low level, arranging it in a chessboard pattern.

A grainy grid pattern.

The content is extremely difficult to understand due to the poor quality of the image. It appears to be a blurry and indistinct representation of something, making detailed analysis impossible.

As a result of enhancing visibility, the original image became overexposed, resulting in a predominantly white appearance and loss of detail.

The hidden image is becoming clearer.

The final image has disappeared, but the hidden image now fully appears.
