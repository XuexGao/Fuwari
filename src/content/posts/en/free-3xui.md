# Formal commencement.

First, we need to identify a website built using 3x-ui that leverages [Network Space Surveying, Network Space Security Search Engine, Network Space Search Engine, Safety Situation Perception - FOFA Network Space Surveying System](https://fofa.info/).

Upon entering, we initiate a search for 3x-ui websites and specifically target the Hong Kong region.

接下来我们制作一个TXT文档，里面全部都是搭建了3x-ui的网站，如图![](../../assets/images/8b9390ec-61b0-4f78-8d76-aa2b7cb136e5.webp)

Then we need to determine the login mechanism for 3x-ui.

Upon normal login, he will request `/login` and send the request body in the format `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8`.

Let's examine the request. It’s remarkably straightforward – simply a single `username` and a single `password`.

Here’s the translation:  “Let's simulate a request in Postman – it’s completely seamless!”

Let’s begin crawling!

The core principle involves requesting websites sequentially, simulating login attempts, and successfully logging into weak passwords. Upon successful login to the website, this information is recorded in a subsequent TXT file.  This process can yield an enormous number of nodes (connections) exploited through repeated logins.
