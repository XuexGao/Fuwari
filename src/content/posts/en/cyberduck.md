This article discusses a new API, Cyberduck, that simplifies accessing and managing cloud storage images by connecting to Cloudflare R2 object storage without the need for traditional S3 APIs or other intermediary services like AList. It highlights Cyberduck's benefits in reducing data transfer times and streamlining file management, offering a more streamlined workflow compared to previous methods involving AList and S3.

# Please provide the text! I need the text to translate.

You may know or not know that I operate a **二次元随机图 API**, such as [AcoFork - RandomPic](https://pic.072103.xyz/).

Its images are stored on **Cloudflare R2**, which is Cloudflare’s object storage service.

Random inventory always needs to be expanded, previously I used [AList](https://alistgo.com/zh/), but now I use `yberduck`.

# What is this?

Cyberduck is a dual-platform (Windows & Mac) cloud storage browser, unlike AList, it doesn't require installation and file transfer is not involved in routing, serving as a front-end to connect your own object storage. It’s simple and user-friendly, with the interface shown below.

You can map cloud storage to a local disk using sister software [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/).

# Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

The image statistics API does not require us to manually interact with S3 API to obtain the number of images anymore.

Upload file without going through my family’s List of Files.

Previous link: I - AList - S3

Current link: I - S3

Significantly reduced transmission time and improved work efficiency.

Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

Not only S3, you can directly use SFTP to transfer files to a family server without logging into 1Panel or other panels.
