# Here’s the translation:  Press release summary.

You may be aware of or unaware of my operation of a **API**, such as [AcoFork - RandomPic](https://pic.072103.xyz/).

The image data is stored in **Cloudflare R2**, which utilizes Cloudflare’s object storage service.

The inventory of random images frequently requires expansion, and previously, I utilized [AList](https://alistgo.com/zh/). However, currently, I rely on [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).

# What is this?

Cyberduck is a dual-platform (Windows & Mac) cloud storage browser that eliminates the need for deployment and avoids data transfer, acting as a front-end to connect your own object storage. It’s designed to be simple and user-friendly, with a visual interface similar to the one shown.

You can map cloud storage to a local disk using sister software [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/).

# Here’s the translation:  What are the advantages?

The API provides image statistics, eliminating the need for manual S3 API interaction to obtain the number of images.

Beyond S3, direct SFTP transfer of files can now be utilized without requiring login to 1Panel and other panels.
