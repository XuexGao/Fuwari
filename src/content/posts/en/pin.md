This article discusses the advantages of using QQ groups compared to Telegram, highlighting that QQ offers a lower barrier to entry for joining and easier moderation due to its popularity within China. It also suggests that users can join non-QQ groups by sponsoring the group, with a minimum sponsorship fee of 10 CNY and requiring a note for further communication.

Here’s a professional translation:  “The need for sponsorship within QQ groups is driven by the platform's inherent risk of being targeted by internal whistleblowers, which can lead to group bans. However, compared to other platforms, QQ offers a significantly lower barrier to entry and facilitates more seamless communication. Furthermore, experienced users may benefit from joining non-QQ groups.”

Please contact us at least [赞助](/sponsors/) before adding a group. When requesting sponsorship, please provide a note with your contact information and any relevant transaction details.
