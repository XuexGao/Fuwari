The article provides links to official and unofficial community groups for "2x.nz," including Telegram and QQ groups, with a note that joining the QQ group requires a minimum sponsorship of 10 CNY to avoid potential platform restrictions. It also mentions that advanced users can join non-QQ groups. A fan-run Telegram group is listed as an unofficial alternative.

# Official
## Telegram group

## QQ Group

> Why do only QQ groups require sponsorship? Because QQ, as a domestic platform, is easily reported by insiders, leading to group bans. However, the threshold is lower, and communication is more convenient. Of course, if you are a premium user, you can join non-QQ groups.

Please first [sponsor](/sponsors/) at least **10 CNY** before joining the group. When sponsoring, it is recommended to leave a note; when joining the group, fill in the note or transaction order number you left.
