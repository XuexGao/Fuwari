# Official
## Telegram group.

Telegram: Join the chat group at [2x.nz].
## QQ group.

Here’s the translation:  “Why is it necessary to sponsor QQ groups? Because QQ, as a domestic platform, is susceptible to being reported and banned by internal informants, which can lead to group closures. However, the barrier to entry is significantly lower than that of traditional groups, facilitating more seamless communication. Furthermore, advanced users can join non-QQ groups.”

Please provide a minimum of [sponsorship](/sponsors/) before adding a group. When requesting sponsorship, it’s recommended to include a note with your notes or transaction order number.
