# Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

Early articles were published on this website [https://www.example.com](/posts/bypass-gfw/).
This article does not comply with regulatory requirements. Attempts to submit it for review have resulted in a re-approval ban.

# Domain does not comply with备案 regulations.

The ICP备案 is for a domain name that belongs to me, and my domain name 2x.nz is not within the ICP备案 supported by any domain suffix.

All support domains have a .com suffix. See https://domain.miit.gov.cn/

# The effects of the nodes are diminishing rapidly.

Currently, the platform utilizes Netlify CDN, which leverages AWS’s IP address and offers extremely fast speeds in mainland China. The latency is shown in the following image:

Due to the fact that this platform is a static site, using EdgeOne Page’s China大陆 node will result in lower latency compared to using the current speed. However, the effectiveness of this delay is minimal.

# The registration process can be quite involved.

If you register, you will need to provide your actual operating person information and purchase a registration code (this is the most cost-effective way to register).

# GFW has disabled SNI blocking for this platform.

The platform is currently not blocked by GFW. While some provinces’ firewalls may have non-compliant blocking, all access is possible normally.

# Zhezhou and other regions users only support access via registered domain names?

The previous platform had an IP address that was disrupted during the upgrade to V2, causing a disruption of our CI/CD workflow. The service is currently unavailable.

The following steps are being taken to restore the website’s operations:

See the interface [about](/about/).

# Following up on this matter.

Possible, but not primarily used for business purposes; it primarily aims to improve accessibility and is currently unapproved for public use.

I may abandon managing two content branches, namely those with no violation content and the original branch.
