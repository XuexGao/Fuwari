This article details a situation where the website has been temporarily blocked by DDOS attacks and is currently undergoing a re-registration process due to non-compliance with regulations. The site utilizes Netlify CDN, which offers fast speeds but limited accessibility in China.  The article highlights the complexities of the process, including the need for specific operational information and the potential disruption caused by an IP station upgrade.  Furthermore, it clarifies that while GFW hasn't blocked the site, some non- domains are still being restricted through firewall measures. The future of the website’s status remains uncertain, with a focus on improving accessibility rather than primary business operations.

# Violation content.

Early content was published on this platform [view here](/posts/bypass-gfw/).
The article does not comply with the regulatory requirements for submission. Attempts to submit it under a submitted form were unsuccessful.

# Domain registration is not permitted to be registered.

The ICP is specifically for domain names. My domain name, 2x.nz, is not supported by the ICP registry.

Please consult the following link for information on approved domain suffixes: [https://domain.miit.gov.cn/](https://domain.miit.gov.cn/)

# The efficacy of the Chinese nodes is diminishing rapidly.

Currently, the platform utilizes Netlify CDN, leveraging AWS’s IP address for fast speeds. Availability in mainland China is exceptionally high, as indicated by the latency visualization below.

Due to the fact that this platform is a static site, utilizing EdgeOne Page’s China Mainland Node directly offers lower latency. However, the speed benefits are minimal compared to current performance.

# The process of registering can be quite involved.

If you are required to register, you will need to provide details about your actual operating personnel and purchase a registration code (this is the most cost-effective registration method).

# GFW has disabled SNI blocking for this platform.

The platform is currently not blocked by GFW. While some provincial firewalls have been disabled for non-compliant domains, normal access is possible across all provinces.

# Users in Quanzhou and surrounding areas are limited to accessing websites using registered domain names.

The previous platform featured an IP address-based site, which was disrupted by the upgrade to V2 of the business server 1Panel V1. Consequently, the existing CI/CD workflow has been temporarily suspended.

Following repairs and a restoration of the website’s IP address, the ongoing efforts will continue.

The system has been restored. See the [About](/about/) interface.

# What is the process for seeking regulatory approval to continue operations?

Possible, but not primarily utilized for core business operations. It serves primarily to enhance accessibility and is currently unapproved for web hosting.
