# Google Adsense is a digital advertising platform that allows website owners to monetize their content through ads. It’s a system where advertisers pay publishers for each time someone views or clicks on an ad on their site.

It is a Google advertising service. Once your website has been approved by AdSense, Google will begin inserting advertisements on your site to generate revenue for you.

# Application Google Adsense

Go to https://adsense.google.com and fill out the relevant information, and verify ownership through all three methods (recommended).

The address field must be filled with **Real, accurate**. Because before your first withdrawal, Google will send you a **Verification Code**. Without this verification code, you won’t be able to withdraw.

Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

The content guarantees your website meets Google’s AdSense requirements, increasing your chances of passing the review.

# You need to do what?

1. Do not remove the AdSense JavaScript code. This JS is Google's method of inserting dynamic ads.
2. Do not frequently change domain names. Ensure your domain remains available for a prolonged period after submission.
3. During the review period, please regularly update the website with new content. Ensure that the latest articles are recent to demonstrate your website’s activity.
4. In search engines, a good SEO can be achieved by visiting your website at `site: xx.xx`. You can find more information on how to improve your SEO in the official website of 《二叉树树》: [如何提高网站的SEO？ - 《二叉树树》官方网站](/posts/improve-seo/)
5. Website original articles reaching 30+ pages and achieving a passing grade of 15 is better than 15, and the more, the better, with originality exceeding 70%.
6. Do not display inappropriate content, including content that could be considered sexually suggestive, violent, or promoting conflict. Even such content may attract a large number of visitors.
7. Privacy Policy Page Setup. A reputable website should respect visitors’ personal privacy, and you must state the types of information you collect and the measures you will take to protect them.
8. Adding a cookie consent component. If your website analyzes visitor behavior or collects visitor data and transmits it to third-party entities, you must disclose this information and provide users with the option to protect their personal information.
9. Website promotion, aimed at increasing legitimate traffic, can be achieved through various methods such as posting on large forums, establishing social media content distribution, and utilizing video and audio content to attract more users.
10. Enhance website engagement. It can be used to display comments from users and show access volume, thereby creating a sense of popularity and boosting website activity.
11. Ensure website stability through Cloudflare hosting, offering zero-cost protection against DDoS attacks. Ensures your website remains available during AdSense review periods.
12. Always apply for, and continue applying until approved.

# My journey through life.

Since August 25th, 2023 (actually earlier), I started applying for AdSense. During this time, I was repeatedly rejected, but finally succeeded in passing.

The primary reason for rejection initially was low value content, but subsequent direct violations of AdSense guidelines have resulted in no further detailed explanations.

I remain undeterred, I continue to apply, each application makes the website more user-friendly and more useful.

From its initial focus on just over 50 articles, to today’s 137 articles.

From a simple, static website to today’s sites with access counts, comment sections, article diffs, and various small features.

From the initial lack of friendships, to today’s 109 friends.

From the initial array of tracking devices, to the increasingly structured classification system, visitors can freely adjust the information they allow to be collected.

From the initial blog, only providing content for review, to today’s website, a wide range of premium features should be available.
