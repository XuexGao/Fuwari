# Google AdSense is a program that allows website owners to monetize their content through advertisements. It’s a revenue-sharing model where advertisers pay Google for displaying ads on their websites, and in return, Google displays those ads alongside the user’s browsing experience.

It is a Google advertising service offered as part of their AdSense program. Once your website has been approved by Google, the platform will insert advertisements on your site to generate revenue for you.

# Application for Google AdSense

Please visit [https://adsense.google.com/](https://adsense.google.com/) and complete the website information, including ownership verification through three methods – please do so all of them.

The address field must be filled with **Authentic, Precise**. As a Google verification step, you will receive a **Verification Code** before you can initiate a withdrawal. This code is essential for successful transaction completion.

While other items may not have strict requirements, it is recommended to provide a genuine and thorough response.

Upon submission, Google will review your website. Generally, it will not pass the first few times, but you are incredibly fortunate! Reading this article ensures your site meets AdSense requirements and passes through with ease.

# Please tell me what you need to do with the video.

1. **Do not remove the AdSense JavaScript code**. This JavaScript is Google’s method for dynamically inserting advertisements.
2. Please avoid frequent domain name changes after submission. Ensure your domain remains available for a prolonged period following the application process.
3. We are committed to regularly updating the website during the review process, ensuring that the latest content is available.
4. Here’s the translation:  “Ensure your website is optimized for search engines through SEO (Search Engine Optimization). By visiting [site:xx.xx] in a search engine, you can obtain valuable results. For more detailed guidance on improving your website's SEO, refer to the official website: [How to Improve Your Website’s SEO - The Official Site](/posts/improve-seo/)”
5. **Website Original Articles Achieving 30+ Pages and a Passing Grade of 15 Pages is Excellent. The more, the better, and originality should exceed 70%.**
6. Please refrain from displaying content that includes inappropriate material, such as pornography, violence, or conflict. Even seemingly innocuous content can attract significant traffic and engagement.
7. Here’s the translation:  “**Privacy Policy Page Setup**.” A reputable website should respect visitor privacy and clearly outline the types of information collected, as well as the measures taken to protect that data.
8. **Implement Cookie Consent Component**  If your website conducts analytics to track visitor behavior or transmits this data to third-party entities for analysis, you are obligated to disclose this information and provide users with the option to control their personal data.
9. Here’s the translation:  “**Optimize your website for increased legal traffic.** This can be achieved through various channels, such as posting on large forums, utilizing social media marketing with engaging content (audio and video), and driving traffic to your site.”
10. **Enhance Website Engagement**  This can be implemented by integrating comment sections into the website and displaying visitor data, thereby increasing the perception of website popularity and boosting user engagement.
11. Here’s the translation:  “Ensure website stability through Cloudflare hosting, offering zero-cost protection against DDoS attacks. This guarantees your site remains operational during AdSense review periods.”
12. Here’s the translation:  “AdSense does not have a blacklist for this type of mechanism. If an application is rejected, please improve your website and reapply until it passes the review process.”

# My journey through life.

Since August 25th, 2023 (and earlier), I’ve been actively pursuing AdSense eligibility. Throughout this period, I have experienced repeated rejections, but I successfully passed the application process today.

The initial reason for rejection was low value content, but subsequent direct violations of the Adsense guidelines resulted in no further explanation provided.

Despite my continued efforts, I remain committed to applying, and each application consistently improves the website’s usability and functionality.

From the initial collection of just over 50 articles, to the current total of 137 articles.

From the initial, simple static-only read-only site to today’s expanded functionality including access counts, comment sections, article diffs, and various small features.

From the initial period of no friendships, to today’s 109-friendship network.

From the initial proliferation of tracking devices to the increasingly structured categorization of visitors, guests can now freely adjust the information they allow to be collected.

From the initial blog, primarily serving as a platform for article browsing, to today’s comprehensive website offering a wide range of premium features, all types of offerings are available.
