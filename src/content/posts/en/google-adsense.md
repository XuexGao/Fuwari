# What is Google AdSense?

It is an advertising service provided by Google. Once your website passes the Adsense review, Google will begin displaying ads on your site to visitors, allowing you to earn revenue.

# Apply for Google AdSense

Go to https://adsense.google.com/, fill in your website's relevant information, and complete ownership verification (there are three methods; it is recommended to do all of them).

The address field must be filled with **accurate and real** information. Because before your first withdrawal, Google will send you a **physical verification code** by mail, and without this verification code, withdrawal will not be possible.

Although other entries are not strictly required to be filled out, it is also recommended to fill them out honestly and truthfully.

After submission, Google will review your website. Generally, the first few attempts will not be approved, but you're very lucky! Having read this article, it will ensure your website meets Adsense standards and passes on the first try!

# Main Content: What do you need to do for the website

1. **Do not remove the Adsense JS code**. This JS is how Google dynamically inserts ads.
2. **Do not frequently change your domain name**. After submitting your application, ensure your domain remains consistently available for an extended period of time.
3. **Update your website frequently during the review period**. At least ensure that your latest articles are recent to demonstrate that your website is active.
4. **Have good SEO on search engines**. Search your website: `site: xx.xx` to get a decent search result. See also: [How to Improve Your Website's SEO? - Official Website of "Binary Tree Tree"](/posts/improve-seo/)
5. **Original articles on the website reach 30+**. The passing threshold is 15 articles, but more is better, and plagiarism or direct copying is not allowed; originality must exceed 70%.
6. **Do not post prohibited content**. Such as pornographic, violent, or provocative content, even if such content may temporarily attract a large number of visitors.
7. **Set up a privacy policy page**. A legitimate website should respect visitors' personal privacy; you need to declare what information you collect from visitors and what protective measures you will take.
8. **Add a Cookie Consent Component**. If your website analyzes visitor behavior, or collects visitor data and passes it to third parties for analysis, you are not only required to disclose this practice, but also need to give users the option to choose, allowing visitors to protect their personal information.
9. **Promote your website to increase legitimate traffic**. You can boost your website's traffic through various methods, including but not limited to posting on large forums and creating social media content with video and audio to attract visitors. This will help more users become aware of and visit your website.
10. **Enhance website interaction**. You can integrate a comment section or visitor count display, making the website appear popular and increasing its activity level.
11. **Ensure the website runs stably**. It is recommended to host your website with Cloudflare, which can defend against DDoS attacks at zero cost. Ensure your website remains accessible throughout the Adsense review period.
12. **Always apply, and keep applying until approved after rejection**. AdSense does not have a blacklist mechanism; if your application is rejected, improve your website and reapply until your application is approved.

# My inner journey

Since August 2025 (actually earlier), I have been applying for Adsense. I was rejected every time until I finally succeeded today.

The initial reason for rejection was **low-value content**, but in subsequent instances, it directly changed to "account violates Adsense policies," without providing detailed reasons anymore.

But I have never given up; I have always applied, and each application has made the website easier and more useful to use.

From the initial 50-plus articles to the current 137 articles

From the initial simple static read-only site, to today's version that includes traffic statistics, comment sections, article diffs, and various small features.

From the initial proliferation of various trackers to today's categorized and organized approach, visitors can freely adjust the information they allow to be collected.

From the initial blog, which only provided article browsing, to today's official website, featuring all kinds of premium functionalities.
