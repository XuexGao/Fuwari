# 说在前面
First, it is advisable to record a video of the opening of any expensive electronic devices.

A professional opening video should:

- Here’s the translation:  “The complete, undamaged packaging for the shipment.”
- Here’s the translation:  “The complete disassembly process was recorded, with no obstructions or omissions.  Please note that footage should be edited to remove any unwanted elements.”
- Here’s the translation:  “Presenting the contents of the packaging, including **Electronic products, user manual, warranty card, etc.**”
- Please verify if there was an error in the shipment, including a missing item and/or a misplaced item.
- Please inspect the product’s appearance for damage and staining.
- Here’s a professional translation of the text:  “The recording process begins with product activation and testing.”
- If you do not wish to proceed with the order, please complete the filming and packaging process for a return and refund.

Here’s the translation:  “Opening a box video isn't always necessary, but it can significantly reduce disputes when utilized.”

# Activation principles and bypass mechanisms.

A pre-installed Windows 10 or 11 laptop computer automatically activates upon its first network connection after manufacturing, and cannot be revoked.

Once connected to the internet, your laptop will…
- Microsoft server communication and automatic activation, including the reporting of motherboard ID and activation code, enabling automated activation without manual intervention.
- The license must be written into the system, regardless of whether it’s offline or reactivated through a process of forced reactivation.

The problem appears to be unsolvable, yet there is a solution. It can be attributed to Windows activation and the openness of the x86 architecture motherboard, allowing us to implement the following measures:
Here’s the translation:  “The system is not activated, yet it can still connect to the network for testing and does not compromise the factory-installed system.”

First, it’s important to understand that Windows activation is not a license that automatically applies to all versions. Currently, approximately 99% of laptop computers are pre-installed with the **Windows 10/11 Home Chinese Version** after they are connected to the internet and activate automatically.

We can install a system (such as the Professional or Workstation versions) that is compatible with non-Windows 10/11 families.

Following this system, we conducted widespread network testing within the system itself.

Finally, the testing is complete. If you are not satisfied and wish to return, please delete the **Ourself-installed** system, then provide a full refund within 7 days, after which, as long as you package the items securely and without any missing pieces, **100% Buyer Protection!**

# Practical
Prepare a USB drive for easy system installation.

First, purchase a laptop computer and upon arrival, it will automatically power on.

Shut down, then restart, entering BIOS. Select the USB drive as the boot device and enter the PE system within the USB drive.

Please open the partition tool, such as DiskGenius, and create a new partition for installing a fresh system.

Download the multi-version ISO files from Microsoft’s official Windows 10/11 download portal.

Please note that the installation of ISO files should not include the Windows Home Chinese version, and any other version is acceptable.

Turn on, test.

If you wish to initiate a return, please re-enter the package, restore the partition, and then pack and ship the return receipt for refund.

# The system has been activated, and it is attempting to deactivate itself.
Experimental methods should not be activated before you are absolutely certain of your decision. This method may negatively impact the retailer’s subsequent sales, and we appreciate your understanding.

As requested, here’s the translation:  “Assuming I’ve been messing around with the internet and activated Windows Home Edition automatically, it appears.”

Thank you for your patience. Activation is activation, and if the retailer wishes to verify, they will do so. This device is therefore ****. You cannot alter Microsoft’s database, but if the retailer solely focuses on **system layer** whether it's activated, that strategy might be worth exploring.

First, using HKU (Hardware Key Update Utility) to remove the current system key. Subsequently, open Settings and Windows will be reactivated.

At this point, I need to find a **Professional Edition** key and select it. Input the key, wait for the system to automatically upgrade to **Professional Edition**.

Therefore, we are requesting a return.

Here’s the translation:  “This method bypasses the requirement for online activation by allowing the device to operate without network connectivity when it reaches the gambling establishment. If the retailer attempts to activate the device via a troubleshooting process, the device will automatically activate upon reverting to the Windows Family Chinese version if the device's operating system has been modified.”
