# 说在前面
First, you should record a **opening video** for any **expensive electronic products**.

A professional unpacking video should:

- Complete packaging for the delivery.
- Complete unpacking process. No obstructions, no missing shots, no editing.
- The contents of the packaging include electronic products, manuals, and warranty cards.
- Check if there’s a defect, incorrect shipment.
- Product appearance has **damage, stains**.
- The product was turned on and tested during the recording.
- Okay, I understand. Please provide the text.

Opening a box video isn’t always necessary, but it can significantly reduce disputes when used correctly.

# Activation principles and bypass mechanisms

Modern laptops with Windows 10/11 pre-installed automatically activate upon their first network connection after manufacturing, and cannot be revoked.

Once I’m online, your computer will…
- Microsoft server communication and automatic activation, reporting motherboard ID and activation code, automatically activate, without manual intervention.
- The license was written into the system, even if it were deactivated and reactivated by chance.

The following measures can be taken to address this issue:  1.  Activate the Windows version with appropriate licensing and open compatibility with x86-based motherboards. 2.  Implement the following steps to resolve the problem:     *   Update drivers.     *   Reinstall Windows.     *   Check for hardware compatibility issues.
The system is not activated, but it can still connect to the network for testing and does not damage the factory-installed system.

Windows activation is not a license that activates all versions. Currently, 99% of laptops are pre-installed with the Windows 10/11 Home family and automatically activate this version after connecting to the internet.

You can install a non-Windows 10/11 family version of the system (such as Professional, Workstation Edition).

We are conducting widespread network testing within our own self-installed system.

The final product is a fully functional system. We’ve rigorously tested it and are confident in its performance.  We offer a 7-day risk-free return policy, ensuring complete satisfaction. If you package the item securely and without any missing items, we guarantee a 100% full refund.

Prepare a USB drive for easy PC installation.

Purchase a laptop computer, and once delivered, automatically power on.

Turned on, then entered BIOS, selected USB as the boot device, entering the USB PE system.

Open partition tools like diskgenius and partition a new space for a fresh system.

Visit the official Microsoft Windows 10/11 download site to download multiple versions of the ISO (some are called multi-edition ISOs).

The ISO installation guide includes instructions for installing Windows Home Edition, but it does not include a version specifically for Windows 10 or later.  It’s recommended to use the standard Windows Home Edition installer.

Turn on, test.

If you are returning an item, please go back to the pre-order stage, restore the partition, and then pack and ship the return refund.

# The system has been activated and wants to deactivate.
Experimental methods; please do not activate the system before you are absolutely certain of your decision. This method may negatively impact the retailer’s subsequent sales, so please understand their concerns.

I have already activated Windows Home Chinese version.

The machine is now activated. If the retailer only looks at **system layer** to determine activation, then this tactic can be tried.

First, uninstall the current system key using He KMS. Then, open Settings, and Windows will be reactivated.

The system has automatically upgraded to the professional version.

This method does not allow the device to query activation status when it’s offline, and once the device reaches the gambling establishment, the gambling establishment cannot activate Windows through clicking on troubleshooting solutions. However, if the gambling establishment will flash the Windows version, then it will automatically activate, revealing the vulnerability.
