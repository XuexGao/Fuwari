title: "AI Doesn't Write Quality Code? It’s Actually You Leading the Way!"
description: "Now, large language models are flourishing, with OpenAI’s ChatGPT series and Anthropic’s code-focused Claude series leading the way. However, even the most advanced models are rendered ineffective if utilized improperly by those who employ unsuitable methods."

# Correct guiding methods.

Please clarify your specific requirements. This includes the programming language you’d prefer, the technology stack you’re interested in, and the precise functionality you need to implement. Furthermore, please specify the application's context – is it a frontend, backend, or full-stack solution?

The clarity and conciseness of your requirements are well expressed.

比如： `编写一个Python脚本，在代码中硬编码S3_Endpoint、S3_Area、S3_key、S3_Secret、S3_Url（暂时全部留空）。运行后监听Ctrl+Alt+A，一旦被按下，立即检查剪贴板内是否有图片（支持文件格式和纯图格式），将其转换为Webp格式并上传到S3 API的S3_Url路径下，最后模拟键入![](图片链接)`

If you’re unsure whether the AI understands your needs, please contact us to confirm and ensure it accurately reflects your requirements. For example, the previous statement could be revised as: “If you’re uncertain about the AI’s understanding of your needs, please reach out for confirmation.”

`编写一个Python脚本，在代码中硬编码S3_Endpoint、S3_Area、S3_key、S3_Secret、S3_Url（暂时全部留空）。运行后监听Ctrl+Alt+A，一旦被按下，立即检查剪贴板内是否有图片（支持文件格式和纯图格式），将其转换为Webp格式并上传到S3 API的S3_Url路径下，最后模拟键入![](图片链接)。你明白了吗，请告诉我你将要如何完成这个任务，在我批准前请不要编写代码`

Sometimes, expressing ambiguity can actually be beneficial.

Because you begin describing the creation of a variable and assigning it a value, you are not using AI to write code; rather, you are instructing the AI to translate your natural language code into programming language code. This is not a creative requirement, but rather a translation-focused need – the quality of the resulting code is entirely dependent on your technical expertise and logical reasoning skills.

Therefore, when addressing most needs, we can initially outline a framework to determine the appropriate direction for AI and then gradually develop the project.

AI systems are prone to errors and frequently make incorrect assumptions. It’s crucial to verify information obtained from AI sources with reliable resources such as [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org).

Here’s the translation:  “Modern AI development environments increasingly employ an agent model, wherein AI systems are designed to autonomously handle user requests and then iteratively refine their solutions, debug potential errors, and ultimately deliver the final project.”

After six months of experience with AI development environments, if code exhibits bugs, it’s best to avoid phrasing like “`this code doesn't run, let me know`” instead. Instead, I recommend providing the complete error message and requesting a thorough analysis and resolution, such as:

Here’s the translation:  “The error message indicates a problem and requires a detailed analysis based on the error details to determine the root cause. Please provide a solution.”

Due to occasional program errors, they may simply be a result of an improperly configured environment variable or a lack of utilizing a widely adopted solution. Simply prompting the AI to self-reproach will likely lead it to focus on its perceived source of failure.

Here’s a professional translation of the text:  “It’s important to consider alternative perspectives. The client consistently expresses concerns about the proposed solution, yet fails to provide specific feedback on its shortcomings. However, AI operates based on its own internal logic and will inevitably pursue a path that aligns with its assessment of optimal outcomes, even if it requires multiple iterations and bug fixes before reaching a satisfactory resolution.  Furthermore, the cost associated with requests, including the number of attempts to reach the iteration limit, is often wasted.”

Finally, utilize AI to your advantage; you may ask it: `What is the best way to utilize AI?` Of course, she might deceive you.

# AI Recommendation

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)：快速，不限额。适合解决你的疑问

Here’s the translation:  “Compared to GPT, Claude offers greater power and excels in code generation, particularly for front-end development.  Many AI coding environments now support models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and beyond, making it highly suitable for creating modular, maintainable scripts.”

![](../../assets/images/f9adcc5e-64bc-48f0-8845-893242abec33.webp)

Here’s the translation:  **[VS Code (Github Copilot)](https://code.visualstudio.com/): An AI-powered IDE developed by Microsoft. Users can leverage Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, but with limited access. The Pro plan costs $10 USD per month, and is only available via PayPal and international payment methods.**

[Trae (International Version)](https://www.trae.ai): An AI development platform developed by ByteDance. It requires international IP addresses. New users on the Pro plan can activate their first month for only $3 USD per month (after which it is $10 USD per month). Support for Alipay and overseas cards is available. I am currently utilizing it.

Do not recommend using web-based large language models for any project. Please utilize AI development environments instead.
