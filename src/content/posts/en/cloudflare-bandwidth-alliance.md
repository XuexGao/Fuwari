# How do you use it?

Here’s the translation:  “If you have an Azure Cloud Service (AWS) instance, a standard approach involves creating a CNAME record to point your domain name to an endpoint hosted by Alibaba Cloud.  However, if you are utilizing Cloudflare's DNS service for hosting your domain, simply opening up the Cloudflare dashboard is sufficient.”

Here’s the translation:  Cloudflare will manage and charge for your Azure Open Source (OSS) traffic originating from Cloudflare’s global network, eliminating charges associated with this traffic.

Based on the free storage policy offered by AliCloud for 5G, you can reap savings on data storage.

# 注意事项

Never disclose your origin server, which is the Cloudflare OSS Endpoint mentioned previously. If anyone discovers your origin server, this traffic will not be routed through Cloudflare to the public internet, and you will incur charges.

Here’s the translation:  “Most storage service providers offer private access configuration, and detailed rules and usage guidelines can be found through your respective customer support channels.”
