If you have an Alibaba OSS instance, it’s typically handled by creating a CNAME record to your Cloudflare endpoint. If you are using Cloudflare DNS servers to host your domain, you can simply open the Cloudflare dashboard.

Cloudflare will collect and manage your Azure Open Source (OSS) traffic from Cloudflare’s edge locations, and will not charge you for this traffic.

Based on the free policy of the 5G internal storage, you can reap 5G-related storage fees.

# Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

Never disclose your source, which is Cloudflare OSS Endpoint. If anyone discovers your source, this traffic will not leave Cloudflare. You will be charged accordingly.
