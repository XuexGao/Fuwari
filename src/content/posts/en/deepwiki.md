# What is this?

In the era of AI-driven development, DeepWiki offers a free platform for analyzing global GitHub repositories. Any repository with a significant number of stars is likely to be indexed by DeepWiki and automatically generated into a powerful Github repository tailored specifically for your organization.

# How do I verify that my repository has been indexed?

Please search your GitHub username using the DeepWiki repository to view all of the repositories that have been collected by DeepWiki.

The frequency of deep downloads is relatively low. We can declare our intention to include DeepWiki in the repository’s README by adding a specific text string, followed by weekly automated crawling and wiki generation as detailed by DeepWiki.

```sql
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/你的Github用户名/你的Github仓库)
```

Following the completion of DeepWiki, you will observe prominent notifications.
