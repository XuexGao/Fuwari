DeepWiki is a free AI service that automatically generates smart, conversational wikis for GitHub repositories with some stars. Users can opt-in by adding a badge to their README, after which DeepWiki crawls the repo weekly to create and update its AI-powered documentation. The service also allows embedding DeepWiki into websites or apps to enable users to ask questions directly without manually building knowledge bases.

# What is this?

In the era of AI-driven development, DeepWiki offers free AI to analyze GitHub repositories worldwide. As long as your repository has some stars and is somewhat popular, it may be included by DeepWiki, and an AI-powered model will automatically generate a powerful Wiki tailored specifically for your GitHub repository!

# How can I check if my repository has been indexed?

Go to [DeepWiki | AI documentation you can talk to, for every repo](https://deepwiki.com/) and search for your **Github username** to view all your repositories currently indexed by DeepWiki.

DeepWiki's crawling frequency is not very high. We can declare in the repository's README that this repository wishes to be included by DeepWiki. As DeepWiki states, it will crawl the latest code once a week and generate a Wiki.

```sql
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/你的Github用户名/你的Github仓库)
```

Afterward, if DeepWiki has already indexed this repository, you will see a prominent notification.

# What next...?

You can embed DeepWiki on your website, service, or app, allowing users to directly ask DeepWiki when they encounter issues! No longer do you need to manually build your knowledge base!
