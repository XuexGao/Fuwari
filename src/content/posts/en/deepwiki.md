# What is this?

In the era of AI Avenue, DeepWiki provides free AI tools to analyze global GitHub repositories. If your repository has stars and is moderately popular, it may be listed by DeepWiki and automatically created with a powerful Wiki tailored specifically for your Github repository by an AI large model.

# How can I check if my repository has been indexed?

Go to [DeepWiki] and search your [Github username] to see all of the repositories that have been collected by DeepWiki.

The frequency of DeepWiki crawls is relatively low. We can declare this repository's intention to accept new code by adding a text to the README file, and then, as DeepWiki stated, will crawl the repository weekly and generate a Wiki.

The content is:  CRITICAL RULES: 1. Output ONLY the translated text. No chatter, no 'Here is the translation', no explanations. 2. Keep all special tags like [content], **content**, *content*, `content` exactly as they are. Translate the 'content' inside the tags, but do NOT remove or alter the [[X: ]] markers. 3. If the input is in Chinese, you MUST translate it to English. Never return Chinese text. 4. DO NOT wrap the output in quotes unless the original text was wrapped in quotes.

You can use DeepWiki on your website, service, or app to directly ask for help when users encounter problems. No need to manually build your knowledge base!
