Referenced the guide on “How to unpack and export VR4 games and Mod creation” on 知乎.

# Download forbidden zone.

Go to https://www.cbjq.com/ and download and install the Dust White Zone, ensuring that the launcher can start the game directly from within (meaning the complete game package is already downloaded to your computer).

# Confirmation of the VRX version

Navigate to the directory containing the EXE file of the placement dust white zone game’s core.

```bash
C:\SeasunCBJQos\Game\cbjq\game\Game\Binaries\Win64
```

Right-click `Game.exe` and click "Properties," then navigate to the "Detailed Information" section. You can see it’s `UE4 4.26`. Remember him, and refer to this later in the text.

# Please separate the CG files from the PAK file.

To travel.

```bash
C:\SeasunCBJQos\Game\cbjq\game\Game\Content\Paks
```

All PAK files have been listed, as we only need CG images, so we are also processing similar files like `PAK_Game_UI_X-WindowsNoEditor.pak`.

Please provide the text you would like me to translate. I need the text to perform the translation.

# 查看解包后的文件

After unpacking, we received a general UE engine encapsulation file named `.uasset`.

We need to use another tool to export it into a standard format file.

Go to [UE Viewer | Gildor's Homepage](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files). Click `Win32 Version` to download.

![](../../assets/images/2025-08-24-01-30-01-image.webp)

Open `umodel_64.exe`. Fill in the output folder path through `QuickBMS`, check `Override game detection`, and select UE4 4.26, which is the initial version we obtained.

![](../../assets/images/2025-08-24-01-32-43-image.webp)

The file browser is difficult to use, so I recommend exporting the file and then viewing it with Windows Explorer.

The folder you want to export will be displayed as `All Package`. You can choose the output folder here, and I’ll default to that.

Next, please provide the export folder where these general resource files are located.

# Get CG images

The plot centers around a young woman who discovers a hidden world of magic and danger, forcing her to confront a malevolent force seeking to exploit its power.

The exported image CG file is `.TGA` – a lossless image format, which can be viewed with [BandiView - 图像查看器、快速且强大](https://www.bandisoft.com/bandiview/).
