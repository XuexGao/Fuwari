:::ai-summary[AI Summary]{model="google/gemma-3-1b"}
This article details a small project involving an AI trained using Python Flask and a simple in-memory database, culminating in the creation of a memory-based AI model. The project utilizes JSON data initially, but ultimately produces a functioning AI that’s been refined through multiple iterations of testing.  The code is available on GitHub for open-source development.

# Here’s the translation:  Press release summary.

I woke up late last night.

Preparing a snack and going to sleep to rest.

Let’s spread the word about this group on QQ.

Then, I was entrusted with a **neural project**.

Here’s the translation:  “Thus…”

# Let’s go!

Utilize the most familiar Python Flask framework!

Using the simplest memory database!

Then begin training AI!

I initially intended to store this data in JSON format, but the intelligent AI ultimately delivered it as memory storage.

“It’s finally done!” (I’m not sure, I asked it seven times!)

# Please proceed.
