:::ai-summary[AI Summary]{model="google/gemma-3-1b"}
This article details a project involving building an AI assistant using Python Flask, SQLite memory database, and JSON data. The project initially used JSON data but ultimately resulted in the AI generating memory storage instead of the intended output, demonstrating a clever solution by the AI itself.  The project is now available at sixqi.afoim.im for testing and open-source development.
