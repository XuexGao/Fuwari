:::ai-summary[AI Summary]{model="qwen/qwen3-vl-8b"}
A small AI-powered web project was built overnight using Python Flask and an in-memory database, with AI assistance for development. The app is now live at https://sixqi.afo.im and open-source on GitHub. The creator humorously notes it took seven rounds of prompting to complete.

# Previous Summary

Originally, I was woken up in the middle of the night.

Ready to eat something and take a nap.

By the way, chat idly in the QQ group.

Then I was entrusted with a **neurotic little project**

So then...

# Let's get started!

First, use the most familiar Python Flask framework!

Then use the simplest in-memory database!

Then start training the AI!

~~Here, I originally intended to store it using JSON, but the clever little AI ultimately delivered it as in-memory storage.~~

Then it was written out! (~~Not really, I asked a total of 7 times~~)

# Launch!

It is now playable at https://sixqi.afo.im/
