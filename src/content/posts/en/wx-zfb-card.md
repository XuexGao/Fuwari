In China, due to the dominance of Alipay and WeChat Pay, users must rely on bank cards as a bridge to transfer funds between platforms, though this comes with daily spending limits and potential card freezes. While major banks like ICBC or Bank of Communications are often restricted by anti-fraud policies, neutral banks like Bank of Communications or Agricultural Bank offer more flexibility. Despite the convenience of using credit cards without daily limits, they still require funds to be transferred via savings accounts, and merchants often don’t accept them, forcing users to navigate platform-specific payment ecosystems.

# Preface
As the introduction states, China is not like overseas, where a single credit card can be used for everything. When shopping abroad, payments are typically made via POS machines or NFC. In China, thanks to the promotion of QR codes and WeChat/Alipay, we generally have two payment methods: one is that the merchant displays a QR code, and you initiate the payment to them; the other is that you show your payment code, and the merchant scans it to deduct the amount. Whether using method one or method two, payment is not directly deducted from **UnionPay**; instead, you are either using **Alipay** or **WeChat**.

# Payment methods for Left and Right Mutual Combat

So the issue gradually emerged: since **Alipay** belongs to Alibaba and **WeChat** belongs to Tencent, if you want to pay using **Taobao**, which is part of the **Alibaba Group** ecosystem, you cannot use WeChat Pay. Conversely, if you want to make purchases in apps belonging to the **Tencent Group** ecosystem, you also cannot use Alipay.

Then, how can this situation be resolved?

Indeed, the bank card has arrived. Abroad, a bank card is your consumption tool; in China, it serves as your **compatibility layer** between WeChat and Alipay. Suppose all your money is stored in WeChat, but the merchant you wish to pay at only accepts Alipay. In this case, first, you need to bind your bank card to both WeChat and Alipay. You would then need to withdraw funds from your WeChat balance **withdraw** to your bank card, then open Alipay and select **recharge** to top up your Alipay balance with money from your bank card (of course, you can also directly use Alipay to swipe your bank card’s funds).

It seems the problem has been perfectly solved! As long as there's this bank card compatibility layer, your balance is no longer tied to any specific platform! You just need to convert between platforms occasionally when making payments! Is that really the case?
# Bank neutrality, also strict
Because banks are neither affiliated with **Tencent** nor with **Alibaba**, most bank cards can be conveniently bound to WeChat Pay and Alipay for consumption.

However, whether this consumption method is available and user-friendly depends on your issuing bank.

Just a side note: you might not know that Alibaba actually has a bank called ****, but this card **** is not accepted by it. Conversely, Tencent also has a bank called ****, and similarly, this card **** is not accepted by it. Therefore, it's impossible to transfer money painlessly between Alipay and WeChat using such a card.

Then, if you want to allow your balance to circulate across various platforms, you must look for **neutral** banks, such as: **Bank of Communications**, **China Agriculture Bank**, **Guangfa Bank**, etc.

There are so many banks in the world, and they are not all treated equally. Given the country's recent crackdown on **anti-fraud, anti-money laundering**, especially targeting **minority groups**, when you use **China Bank**, **Industrial and Commercial Bank of China**, and other **state-owned major banks** for **large-scale rapid in-and-out transactions**, your accounts are likely to be frozen, and you cannot resolve this via online banking—you must manually visit a branch in person, which is extremely annoying. Therefore, if you need to open an account, choose the nearest bank nearby, and avoid selecting those state-owned major banks.

There are **Bank of Communications**, **Bank of Agriculture**, and **Industrial and Commercial Bank of China** near my home. Currently, I have cards from all three major banks: one Class II card from Bank of Communications (opened offline), one Class I card and one credit card from Bank of Agriculture, and one social security card (Class I) from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, plus another Class I card.

If you haven't studied bank cards, you may not understand categories like Class I, Class II, Class III, special cards, credit cards, etc. Here's a brief overview:
- Class I: Savings Cards. Most issuing banks require **offline card opening**, with daily limits of 10,000 to 50,000 RMB, which you can increase later as your financial capacity grows. Among these, **Social Security Cards and Medical Insurance Cards** that have **savings functionality** are also classified as Class I cards and fall under the category of **special cards**. Generally, an individual may only register **one** Class I card (excluding special cards).
- Category II: Savings Card. Most issuing banks only require you to have a **Class I card from another bank**, and then you can register independently via **online**. Daily limit is 1,000–10,000, not recommended to open.
- Class III Card: Savings Card. Generally used as **Sub-card, Family Card**, with a daily limit of around 1,000 RMB, not recommended for personal use.
- Special Card: Generally a savings card. Most are required by the state for **Social Security, Medical Insurance accounts**, except for multi-purpose cards, which otherwise function the same as Class I cards.
- Credit Card: Has a savings function, but it's not very useful—see details later. Unemployed students can apply, but they receive no credit limit; it is generally used for overseas payments (mandatory CVV/CVC required; merchants do not accept debit cards). Those who are employed will have their credit limit approved based on their employment status.

I once used my savings card from **Industrial and Commercial Bank of China** for online consumption, as I wanted to enjoy Alipay's discounts. I transferred money from WeChat to my bank card first, then used Alipay for payment, but it failed. I went to a branch and complained that I was being treated like a "scheming merchant" for my **large-scale fast-in-fast-out** transactions. Fortunately, after providing my ID, card, and statement, the issue was resolved quickly. Since then, I have never kept money in ICBC again.

Imagine a scenario: you have a Class I card with a daily spending limit of 10,000 CNY, and your card balance is 8,000 CNY. You now wish to purchase an item priced at 6,000 CNY and pay using WeChat Pay or Alipay. You select the wrong style, so you request a refund. Fortunately, the merchant hasn’t shipped the item yet and promptly refunds you. It seems your card has returned to its original state. You reconfirm the style, make the purchase again, but your bank card is rejected, stating that you’ve exceeded the daily limit. Notice this: once your first payment is successfully processed, your daily limit is reduced to 4,000 CNY, even if the original amount is fully refunded back to your card. Once the money has been transferred from your card to the merchant, it counts as spent — whether you ultimately receive a refund or complete the transaction, the limit is deducted at the moment the funds leave your card and reach the merchant, and this deduction cannot be reversed. Similarly, withdrawing money from your card to WeChat Pay or Alipay also consumes your daily limit. Therefore, cross-platform transfers require caution — a careless move may leave your card in a “only-in, no-out” state. If your card is repeatedly declined for transactions, some banks may temporarily freeze your card, requiring you to visit a branch in person with your ID.

# Credit Card and Savings Card
Don't you notice something? In the above text, we mentioned daily limits for Class I, Class II, and Class III, but we did not mention **daily limit** for credit cards. So, does that mean credit cards have no daily limit?

Yes! Credit cards indeed do not have daily limits! However! You cannot directly withdraw money from WeChat Pay or Alipay to your credit card; you must first transfer it to a savings card, then use the **Transfer** function in your bank's app and enter the credit card number to transfer the funds to your credit card.

Hey? Have you noticed another thing? Yes! Even if your credit card has no daily limit, when you finally transfer money to your credit card, your corresponding debit card’s daily limit will still be deducted. In the end, the amount you can transfer in a day is still the same.

Regardless of whether there is a credit limit, major card issuers have partnerships with WeChat Pay and Alipay. Your everyday consumption using a credit card is likely to offer discounts, and each transaction can earn you points (similar to the **cashback** system abroad).

But please note that the cafeteria at my current school only accepts Alipay for payment and does not support credit cards; I can only leave a small balance in my savings card.

This is also a predicament in domestic payments, where major institutions encourage users to pay with credit cards, but some merchants do not accept them. For underage groups without bank cards, transferring money between WeChat and Alipay is extremely difficult, which has led to the emergence of **** services, where intermediaries charge a portion of the fee and help you make the payment (for example, if you only have balance in WeChat but want to buy something on Taobao).

# For giants, we can only compromise.

In recent years, Taobao has grayed out WeChat Scan-to-Pay several times, but most users reported only seeing it a few times, often able to pay today but unable to find the entry point tomorrow. Meanwhile, JD.com has never supported Alipay payments.

For a long time, **Blue-Green Rivalry** will not cease; we still need to transfer money through bank cards across various platforms, and we ourselves bear the risk of our cards being frozen.

When transferring between each other, WeChat typically charges a 0.01% service fee. Small amounts can be withdrawn without service fees by redeeming promotional vouchers. Alipay provides each natural person with a lifetime free withdrawal limit of 20,000 RMB, after which it also charges a 0.01% service fee. To you, this may seem insignificant, but consider how many people use WeChat and Alipay to transfer between their balances every day? Even if each transaction incurs only a 10-cent fee, the revenue generated within a second could be substantial. For giants, we can only compromise.
