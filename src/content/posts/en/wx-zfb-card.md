# Here’s the translation:  “Introduction”
Like the introduction stated, China is not like the West. A credit card swipe everywhere, commonly used for online shopping abroad, usually involves a POS machine payment, or NFC payment in China. Thanks to QR codes and WeChat Pay’s promotion, there are two ways to pay in China: one is a business displaying a QR code, you proactively pay the business, and the other is showing your payment code, the business will scan it and deduct the amount. Whether it's method one or method two isn't directly from **银联** payments, you need to use **支付宝**, or you’re using **微信**.

# The payment method involving mutual combat.

You cannot use WeChat to pay on Taobao (also known as Alibaba), and you cannot use Alipay to pay on Tencent’s platforms. If you want to make payments using these platforms, you need to use either WeChat or Alipay.

So, how can we address this?

The bank card is now in circulation. In foreign countries, the card is your tool for spending, and in China, it’s your means of payment on WeChat and Alipay. If your money is all present in WeChat and Alipay, and you need to make a payment at a merchant that only supports Alipay, then first, you must link your bank card to both WeChat and Alipay. Then, you can open Alipay and select “Charge.” Transfer the funds from your bank account’s balance to your Alipay balance (you can also use Alipay directly to top up your bank account).

You are now eligible for a compatible platform, meaning your balance is not restricted to this one! However, sometimes you need to convert it during payments. Is that correct?
# Bank neutrality, also strictly regulated.
Because banks are not affiliated with **Tencent** or **Alipay**, so most bank cards can be easily linked to WeChat Pay and Alipay for transactions.

Whether this consumption model is suitable and effective depends on your card type.

The Alibaba has a bank called **Netbank**, but it’s not accepted by WeChat. Similarly, Tencent also has a bank called **MeiHongBank**, and neither of these cards is accepted on Alipay. Therefore, obtaining such a card without pain through Alipay and WeChat is impossible.

If the balance needs to flow between platforms, you must find a neutral bank such as **中立的** bank, such as **交通银行**, **农业银行**, or **广发银行**.

世界上有很多银行，但并非所有银行都提供相同的服务。随着国家近几年对**反诈，反洗钱**的打击以及针对未成年人的重视，特别是对于**中国银行**和**工商银行**等大型银行进行大额快进快出时，很可能面临冻结，并且无法通过网银解除。这非常令人不快，因此，如果你要开卡，建议选择附近最近的银行，避免选择那些大型国有银行。

Nearby, there are **China Bank**, **Agricultural Bank**, and **工商银行**. Currently, all three banks have my cards, and I’ve opened a card for the II class card at a branch, an I class card for agriculture, a credit card, and an I class card for social security. There is also an I class card elsewhere.

If you’re unfamiliar with bank cards, you may not fully understand I-class, II-class, III-class, special cards, and credit cards. Here's a brief overview of them.
- Savings cards require **offline opening** and have a daily limit of 1W-5W. Once you have sufficient financial resources, you can withdraw them later. If there is **social security card, medical insurance card**, it is also an I-class card and a special card. Generally, one person can register only one (excluding special cards) of this type.
- Savings cards. Most issuing agencies require you to have a **He-type card**, and can be independently registered through **Online**. The daily limit is 1K-1W, and it’s not recommended to open.
- III-Class Cards: Debit Cards. Commonly used as a **secondary card, friendship card**, with a daily limit of 1K and not recommended for personal use.
- General savings cards are typically required by national regulations for **社保、医保账户** (social security and medical insurance accounts), excluding multi-use cards and those of the same type as one-card accounts.
- Credit card: Offers savings features, but not particularly reliable. See the following for more details. Students without working status can apply, but they do not have a credit limit and are typically used for international payments (requires CVV/CVC verification, not accepted by banks that issue savings cards, and will be issued based on your employment status).

I used my工商银行 savings card for online purchases because I wanted to eat Alipay’s discount, so I transferred my WeChat money to the bank card first, then made a payment through Alipay, and it failed. I went to the branch and said I needed to eat the store clerk's Ma Li face after that, thankfully they gave me an ID and card and receipt, and it was solved in just a few seconds, and I never put money back into the bank again.

The customer attempted to purchase a 6000 CNY item using WeChat or Alipay, then changed their mind and initiated a refund. The retailer hadn’t shipped the item yet, so they promptly issued a refund. Upon reconfirming the product, the bank refused the transaction due to exceeding the daily limit of 10000 CNY.  The customer noticed that after their initial successful payment, their daily limit was only 4000 CNY. Even if the original purchase amount had been returned to their account, the limit remained unchanged upon the transaction.  Furthermore, when attempting to withdraw funds from their card to WeChat or Alipay, the withdrawal would also deduct the daily limit. Therefore, cross-platform transfers require caution, and a mistake could lead to being locked out of your account. Repeated refusals by the bank may result in temporary freezing of your card, necessitating identification verification for physical access.

# Credit card and savings card
The question is whether credit cards have a daily limit. The text mentions “Ⅰ类，Ⅱ类，Ⅲ类” but doesn’t explicitly state that credit cards also have a daily limit. Therefore, it's unclear if credit cards have a daily limit.

Credit cards do not have daily limits. However, your WeChat and Alipay funds cannot be directly transferred to a credit card. You must first transfer them to a savings card, then input the card number through the **Transfer** function in the bank app.

“You’ve discovered another thing, right? Even with a no-limit credit card, the money will still be deducted from your savings account when you transfer it to the credit card. You’ll only have that much money available for one day.”

Credit cards, regardless of credit limit, are partnered with major issuing banks and WeChat Pay. Your daily spending using a credit card is likely to offer discounts and allow you to accumulate points (similar to **cashback**).

However, my school cafeteria only accepts Alipay for payment, and does not accept credit cards. I can only keep a small amount of balance in my savings card.

The domestic payment landscape is currently challenging, with major institutions encouraging the use of credit cards, but some businesses do not accept them. For individuals without bank accounts who want to exchange WeChat and Alipay, it’s extremely difficult, leading to the emergence of **代付** business models, where intermediaries charge fees for assistance (e.g., you only have a limited balance in WeChat but want to buy something on Taobao).

# For giants, we can only compromise.

In recent years, Taobao has experienced several times of disappointment with WeChat QR code payments, but most users have repeatedly encountered them. It’s now often the case that you can pay today but won't be able to find a way to do it tomorrow. Meanwhile, JD does not support Alipay payment.

For a long period, **Blue Green Conquest** has not stopped; we still need to transfer money through bank cards across various platforms, and we are responsible for the risk of our card being frozen.

The fees charged by WeChat for cross-posting transactions are typically 0.01%, and small amounts can be obtained through promotional activities to waive service fees, while Alipay charges a 0.01% service fee for each natural person's lifetime free recharge limit, after which it will also charge a service fee. From your perspective, this may seem insignificant, but how many people are using WeChat and Alipay to cross-post balances? Even with a small transaction fee of one yuan per second, it can create high returns, and for large companies, we must compromise.
