Here’s a summary of the article:

The article discusses the challenges and complexities of using multiple payment methods – WeChat, Alipay, and traditional bank cards – in China. While these platforms offer convenient options for online shopping, they require users to switch between them frequently, leading to potential issues like transaction limitations and account freezes.  This creates a situation where individuals often need to utilize a combination of bank cards and digital wallets to manage their finances effectively. The article highlights the growing trend towards cross-platform payments, driven by the promotion of these technologies, but also acknowledges the difficulties associated with seamless transactions across different platforms. It points out that while major retailers are increasingly accepting WeChat and Alipay, many smaller businesses still lack this functionality.  Finally, the article touches upon the broader issue of digital payment security and regulatory concerns, particularly regarding the use of bank cards and the potential for fraud prevention measures to restrict access.

# Introduction
Similar to the description provided, China differs significantly from foreign countries in its payment methods. In China, a credit card is commonly used for all purchases, and most transactions are processed through POS terminals or NFC payments. However, this is largely due to QR codes and WeChat Pay/Alipay promotions. Two primary payment options exist: firstly, retailers often display QR codes that require the customer to initiate the payment; secondly, you present a payment code directly to the merchant for processing. Regardless of the method employed, these are not direct transactions from **** (UnionPay), but rather utilize **** (Alipay) or **** (WeChat).

# The payment method for mutual combat involves a reciprocal exchange.

The issues have gradually surfaced, as **** is owned by Ali. Similarly, **** is owned by Tencent. If you intend to make payments within **** (also known as the Alibaba system) or ****, you will not be able to use WeChat. Conversely, if you intend to spend your consumption within **** software, you also won't be able to use Alipay.

How can this situation be resolved?

Certainly. The bank card has been activated. In foreign countries, a bank card is a tool for your transactions, and in China, it’s used for payments through WeChat and Alipay.  If all your funds are held within WeChat, and you need to make a payment at a merchant that only accepts Alipay, the first step should be to link your bank card to both WeChat and Alipay. Subsequently, you can open Alipay and select “Charge.” Transfer the funds from your bank account’s balance to your Alipay balance (you can also utilize Alipay to directly recharge your bank account).

The issue has been successfully resolved! With a compatible bank account, your balance is now associated with the unlinked platform. However, sometimes it requires a slight conversion during payments – is this correct?
# Banking operations are conducted with strict adherence to regulations.
Due to the fact that banks are not affiliated with **Tencent** or **Alibaba**, most bank cards can be easily linked to WeChat Pay and Alipay for transactions.

However, the suitability of this consumption method depends on your card type. Whether it’s usable and effective will vary based on the type of card you use.

Regarding a tangential point, it’s worth noting that Alibaba also operates a bank, called **Netbank**, although this card, **WeChat**, is not accepted. Conversely, Tencent also has a bank, called **MeiHongBank**, and similarly, the corresponding card, **Alipay**, is not accepted. Therefore, obtaining such a card through seamless transfer between Alipay and WeChat is not feasible.

If you wish for funds to circulate across various platforms, you must seek a neutral bank, such as **China Bank**, **Agricultural Bank**, or **Guangfa Bank**.

The sheer number of banks worldwide is not uniformly treated, given the recent intensified efforts by the government to combat fraud and money laundering, particularly targeting minors. Utilizing Chinese banks like China Bank and Industrial Bank for large-scale transfers is likely to result in account closures, requiring a physical visit to the branch to unlock them. This process is highly inconvenient, so if you’re seeking a card, prioritize banks located nearby – and avoid selecting larger state-owned commercial banks.

I have accounts with the following banks nearby: ****, ****, and ****. Currently, I have cards from all three banks, and I’ve opened a card for the II class card at a branch of **** (Bank of China), an I class card at **** (Agricultural Bank), and an I class card at **** ()]. Also, I have an I class card from **** (Social Security Card).

If you have not researched bank cards, you may not fully understand the I-level, II-level, III-level, special cards, and credit cards. Here’s a brief overview of these types of cards.
- Here’s the translation:  **Class I Savings Card:** Most issuing institutions require a physical opening of these cards, with daily limits ranging from 10,000 to 50,000. Once your financial resources are sufficient, you can increase the limit.  Specifically, **Social Security cards, health insurance cards**, and those with savings features, are also classified as I-class cards and designated as special cards. Generally, one individual can register only one (excluding special cards).
- Here’s the translation:  **Class II: Savings Cards.** Most issuing institutions require only a basic **Heave-a-Card** card, followed by independent registration through **Online**. The daily limit is between 1,000 and 10,000, and it's generally not recommended to open one.**
- III-Class Cards: Debit cards primarily utilized as a supplementary card, typically with a daily limit of 1,000. They are not recommended for personal use.
- Special cards typically function as savings cards. Most are designated for national account requirements, including employer-provided and individual health insurance accounts. While versatile, they share similar features with standard debit cards.
- Here’s the translation:  **Credit Card:** The card offers savings features, though its usability is limited. Details can be found in the accompanying documentation. Students without a valid credit history may apply, but they do not have an available credit limit and are typically used for international transactions (requiring CVV/CVC verification, and not accepted by banks handling savings accounts). Existing cardholders will receive a credit limit based on their employment status.**

I previously used a savings card from **** for online transactions in order to take advantage of Alipay’s offers. I would transfer my WeChat account funds to the bank card first, then use Alipay for withdrawals, and unfortunately, it failed. After arriving at a branch, I was told that I needed to eat a store employee's "horse face" (a gesture of apology), and thankfully, they provided me with an ID and card along with a receipt, which quickly resolved the issue. Since then, I have never again deposited money into a bank account.

Here’s a professional translation of the text:  “Imagine a scenario where you possess an I-class card with a daily limit of 10,000 CNY. Your current balance is 8,000 CNY. You intend to purchase a 6,000 CNY item via WeChat or Alipay, and subsequently experience a refund due to a product mismatch. Fortunately, the merchant has not shipped the item. The refund is processed smoothly, and your card status returns to its initial state upon subsequent confirmation of the product. Subsequently, you reconfirm the product, and are denied authorization for the transaction. You’ve noted that upon your first successful payment, your daily limit is capped at 4,000 CNY. Even if the original purchase amount has been returned to your account, the transaction itself remains valid, but the limit is already deducted upon the initial transfer from your card to the merchant's side at that moment. Similarly, withdrawing funds from your card to WeChat or Alipay will also deduct your daily limit, necessitating caution when transferring between platforms. A careless action could result in a situation where your card becomes locked and inaccessible, requiring identification verification for offline access.”

# Credit card and savings card
I noticed something important – the previous discussion referenced **daily limit**(B: daily limit) for classes I, II, and III. However, credit cards were not mentioned in that context. Consequently, does credit card usage have a daily limit?

Certainly! Here’s the translation:  “Yes, a credit card does not have daily limits! However, your WeChat and Alipay funds cannot be directly transferred to the credit card. You must first transfer them to a savings account, then input the card number through the **Transfer** function within the bank's mobile app.”

Are you noticing another issue, yes?” “Even with a no-limit credit card, the final transfer of funds to your savings account will still deduct your corresponding limit. How many days can you ultimately access those funds after the transfer?

Credit cards are widely accepted by major issuing banks and offer various benefits, including potential discounts on purchases. Users can accumulate points through everyday spending, similar to a cashback system.

However, I am currently enrolled in a school cafeteria that only accepts payment via Alipay, and it does not accept credit cards. I can only keep a small amount of funds in my savings card.

Here’s the translation:  This is a significant challenge for domestic payment systems, with major institutions encouraging consumers to utilize credit cards. However, some merchants are hesitant to accept them. For individuals without bank accounts who wish to exchange WeChat and Alipay, it presents considerable difficulties, leading to the emergence of **** services. Intermediaries typically charge fees for their assistance, then facilitate the payment process (e.g., when a user has limited funds but wants to purchase goods on Taobao).

# For large corporations, we are limited in our flexibility.

Over the past few years, Taobao has experienced several instances of WeChat scanning and payment issues, with most users consistently encountering multiple scans before finding a viable method for payment. However, JD.com has consistently refused to accept Alipay payments.

For an extended period, **lue Green Clash** has continued unabated. We continue to require funds to be transferred between platforms via bank cards, and we bear the risk of card freezes ourselves.

When transferring via WeChat, typically a service fee of 0.01% is charged. Small amounts can be redeemed for free service credits through promotional activities, while Alipay charges a lifetime of 20,000 RMB per natural person for free replenishment, and then a 0.01% service fee upon subsequent transactions. Considering this may seem minor, however, you wonder how many users are utilizing WeChat and Alipay to facilitate mutual transfers of balances? Even with a small transaction fee of one-cent, a single action can generate substantial revenue, particularly for large enterprises, where compromise is often necessary.
