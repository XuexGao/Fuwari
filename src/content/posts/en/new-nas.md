# Why did I purchase a NAS (Network Attached Storage) several years ago?

This is a common question, like you ask me why I started blogging – I can only give you one answer: I want to do it.

Okay, here’s the translation:  “I have a good understanding of Linux theory and practical experience through cloud servers, so I want to build a 24-hour non-stop home server.”

Initially, I was using it to harass QQBot, which is also the thing I initially wanted to do because if I bought a domestic cloud server to host that Bot would be too expensive, and the latency between the country and overseas servers is too high, using my phone, tablet, and computer as my own is a good option. My friend once used Shamrock (？？?) to harass QQBot. However, this isn’t suitable for me, at the time, all my devices (including phones, tablets, and computers) were each responsible for their own duties, and had to be constantly on duty, I couldn't say that disconnecting my computer/phone/tablet would just shut down the Bot. And I also really dislike using part of my personal device as a server, like in崩坏：星穹铁道 when the background is Stable Diffusion, but it doesn’t fit Unix philosophy.

I used to use an old phone with Termux to achieve cloud-based functionality at home, but because the phone’s chip is Arm64 and most operational software is AMD64 (x86) architecture, it’s easier to work with open-source software. You just need to compile a version from GitHub Actions yourself.
However, as someone accustomed to frequently using Cloud Servers X86 architecture, I also enjoy the convenience of installing some management panels for operational tasks.

Buy an x86 small computer. You may have noticed, I’ve been saying this for so long why I’m still buying an x86 small computer as a home cloud service, but there’s no mention of NAS three times, why is that? It’s called “a full and hot desire for warmth and longing.”

It’s not advisable to simply throw away a large sum of money on a home cloud service – you need to actively work on it. However, during that period, I started constantly tinkering with it, but in reality, this small NAS isn't suitable as a NAS. We all know NAS Chinese is network-attached storage, so naturally, what should we do? Hey! Really pack it up! But the actual small NAS only has one M.2 slot and one SATA port, and the M.2 slot can only accommodate 2.5-inch hard drives.

To put it simply, this isn’t a NAS, is it? It’s just a large storage solution at home. I’ve said this here, you might probably be thinking, why would you buy one? Hey, I bought one of an ASUS dual-core laptop in 2017, and the hard drive for that was a 2.5 inch mechanical hard drive with 512G capacity, although the host couldn’t do RAID either, and it couldn’t fit multiple disks ~~ (it can, later I achieved this through an external USB disk enclosure to create an incredibly unstable RAID0)~~ , but it still could do 24 hours of inactivity, and the N100 performance was sufficient for me, and it was enough to keep me tinkering with all sorts of junk.

At that time, I had built quite a few services and installed quite a bit of systems on this small host. I’ve run almost all the common Linux distributions thoroughly, and also experienced running FlyNet in PVE – it was really fun having new things to tinker with every day.

# So, why did that small host go out of business?

I’m broke, but I don’t know what I’m missing. Haha, writing this just made me laugh, and the herd mentality is really a cruel person. We all know that Apple released Mac Mini in late 2024, with 16+256G storage and educational discounts under $4k can be purchased for a brand new machine. Luckily, one of my friends suggested it, and we started talking about this thing – I completely lost track of everything and ended up spending all of it on me ~~ (I’m a cloth, a small host was horribly attacked, and Redmi Book Pro 15S, Redmi G, Xiaomi Pad 6 etc.)~~.

Smartly managing to get enough money to buy a portable router, it was a complete surprise. The Apple M4 chip is based on the Arm architecture, and many things don’t run, Docker can’t be called, and the GPU isn't supported – in short, this thing is a powerful home server for a smart binary tree, but I won’t use it. However, an intelligent binary tree did something? It sold the router for 3333 RMB at a high price of 4K, with a loss of only 1k.

The purchase of a 3333 RMB unit, including an Apple One Plus 5 Pro 16+512 with national subsidies – 500, resulted in a final transaction of 3299 RMB. It’s a high-performance dessert machine.

# Okay, here's the translation:  "You’re still not as skilled as you were before, aren’t you? What are some more challenging operations next?"

There are many of us, and it’s just now! I ordered a new NAS, and I’m already preparing to work through the night. My friend once said that life is about perseverance, but unfortunately, he was already enlightened, busy with all sorts of things. However, let's talk again, now I feel incredibly free. I will lead my brain, my body, my spirit, and embark on an unprecedented period of sleeplessness, tinkering, toil, and confinement feast.

Haha! I must live on! My teeth!
