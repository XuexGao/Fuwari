# Here’s a professional translation of the text:  “Why did I purchase a NAS (Network Attached Storage) several years ago?”

This is a very common question, like you asked me why I started blogging – I can only offer a brief explanation: I’ve found it fulfilling to share my thoughts and experiences through this medium.

It’s alright, that answer might be a bit cursory. If I were to carefully consider it, I would say I had already developed a solid foundation of Linux theory and practical experience through cloud servers at home. Therefore, I intend to build a 24-hour non-responsive server in my house.

Initially, I utilized it as a QQBot, which was my primary intention – to avoid the exorbitant cost of purchasing domestic cloud servers for the Bot. The latency associated with using foreign servers was also too high, and utilizing my own mobile devices and computers offered a viable alternative. A friend had previously used Shamrock (？？?) to host the Bot. However, this wasn’t suitable for me; at the time, all my devices – including phones, tablets, and computers – were individually managed and required constant attention, making it impossible to maintain 24/7 uptime. I couldn't simply say that my computer or phone would disconnect when the Bot went offline, and I also disliked assigning a portion of my personal equipment as a server. It’s akin to playing： while the background is running Stable Diffusion, for example.  (And this doesn’t conform to Unix philosophy.)

I utilized an older smartphone and Termux to achieve remote access to my home network for some time. However, due to the ARM64 processor on the phone, many operational software primarily utilizes AMD64 (x86) architectures. While open-source software is relatively straightforward – simply compiling a version through GitHub Actions – it’s readily accessible.
As someone who frequently accesses the Cloud Server, I still appreciate the X86 architecture’s ease of use and enjoy integrating it with some management panel tools for enhanced operational support.

The only solution is to purchase an x86 small server. You may have noticed, and I’ve been saying this for so long that I’m still not explaining why I’m investing in an x86 small server as a home cloud service. However, there has been no mention of NAS three times throughout the text. This is because it's a rather poetic and evocative description of desires – a reflection on the complexities of longing and desire.

Simply purchasing a high-priced home cloud storage solution is unsustainable; therefore, I began actively tinkering with it during that period. However, upon closer examination, this particular small NAS isn’t suitable for use as a NAS. We all know NAS in Chinese refers to network-attached storage, so logically, what should we do? Ah, let's get serious about maximizing the price! Nevertheless, this small NAS only boasts one M.2 slot and one SATA port – and the M.2 is already designated as a system drive.

Speaking informally, this is not a NAS. A single-drive device is considered a NAS? It’s simply a large home cloud storage solution. When you think about it now, you might be wondering why you're buying it. Hey, I once purchased an ASUS dual-core laptop in 2017, and the hard drive used for that was a 2.5-inch mechanical hard drive with a capacity of 512GB, although the host couldn’t perform RAID, and it wouldn’t fit multiple drives.  However, it could operate without power for up to 24 hours, and the N100 processor is sufficient for various tinkering.

During that period, I established several services and installed numerous systems on this small host. I’ve thoroughly run through most common Linux distributions, and also experienced the intricacies of running PVE-style nested operations within it. It was quite enjoyable having a constant stream of new things to tinker with during those days.

# Now, let’s revisit this. Since I’ve sold that small server, why is this happening?

I’m struggling with finances, but I don't know what I need money for. Haha, writing this down has actually made me laugh – the herd mentality is incredibly draining, and we all know that Apple’s Mac Mini will be released in late 2024, offering a brand new machine for under $16,000. Luckily, one of my friends suggested it, and we started talking about it. I got swept up in it completely, essentially buying everything I could think of – a whole sheet of fabric, even the Mini was targeted by a venomous hand, and now I’m looking at Redmi Book Pro 15S, Redmi G, Xiaomi Pad 6, etc.

After carefully accumulating funds through offline transactions, I finally purchased a portable device. It was a surprising and somewhat foolish decision; the Apple M4 chip is based on the Arm architecture, rendering many applications unusable, and Docker fails to function with it. In essence, this device functions as a high-performance home server, but I’m not utilizing it.  A brilliant binary tree structure, however, has undertaken a remarkable feat – it successfully sold the item for 3333 RMB within seven days with no returns policy, resulting in a net loss of only 1 RMB.

Finally, I purchased a Samsung 3333 RMB unit with the OnePlus Ace 5 Pro 16GB + 512GB and National Subsidy - 500. I ended up receiving a total of 3299 RMB, making it a truly exceptional high-performance appliance.

# You’re still not as skilled as I am with your actions, isn't it? Are there any more challenging operations you could try?

Here’s the translation:  “Yes, indeed, it’s happening now! I just placed an order for a new NAS device and am fully prepared to dedicate myself to intensive troubleshooting. A friend once said that life is about striving, but unfortunately, they were already enlightened – lost in a whirlwind of commitments. However, let me clarify this: Now, I feel an unprecedented sense of freedom, and I intend to lead my mind, body, spirit, and engage in a truly extraordinary period of sleeplessness, tinkering, and dedication.”

I must survive! My teeth!

Following up on my work has resulted in the creation of new blog posts, and it’s been a long time since I’ve written one. I sincerely apologize for the lack of recent activity; the website's daily active users have reached an alarming level, truly distressing me.
