title: "Recommendations for buying microphones"
description: "Over the past few years, a significant number of smartphones have been tested and reviewed, including numerous models like the 1,000-dollar Shure, RODE, and Flash Audio, as well as smaller, budget-friendly options such as the 100-dollar, half-ear with microphone, and various other devices. Today, we’ll summarize some common pitfalls and issues encountered in this market."

# Please clearly state your requirements.

Here’s the translation:  “Why are you purchasing a microphone? To achieve clearer voice communication with friends? To record audio, including singing and music, or create podcasts?”

# If you simply want to chat with a friend over voice, please.

If you’re utilizing headphones with a headphone control system, you don’t need to purchase a new microphone. Instead, simply use the [NVIDIA Broadcast App - With AI Assistance for Voice and Video | NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.cn/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) or other noise reduction software or services.

# Looking for recording opportunities?

This also pertains to your recording environment – is it quiet? Are there any air conditioning noises? Any background noise? A variety of extraneous noises?

If your recording environment cannot achieve absolute silence, then a **dynamic mixer** is an excellent choice.

Here’s the translation:  “The differences between electrostatic capacitors (EMC) and rotary induction coils (RCI) are significant.”

- Here’s the translation:  **Electrode Capacitors: Designed for Comprehensive Audio Capture, Suitable for Advanced Processing and Those Seeking a More Immersive Experience.**  This device is ideal for applications requiring extensive audio recording and processing, particularly when incorporating post-production enhancements. It's well-suited for users who prioritize quality and detail, and offers ample space for significant audio manipulation – making it an excellent choice for ASMR-style content that amplifies subtle movements and sounds.

- Here’s the translation:  “Dynamic Mixing – Primarily focused on low-frequency audio, with minimal sensitivity to high frequencies.  The recording is exceptionally rich and full without any post-processing.  A key characteristic is its exclusive focus on vocal recordings; however, if the distance between the microphone and the subject is too great, a slight adjustment of 5-30cm may be necessary to improve sound quality.”

Recommended: The Q2U dynamic microphone from Shan Su is currently priced at 279 CNY, but the market price has risen to approximately 400 CNY.

The drawbacks of this microphone centerpiece are its use of an ancient Mini USB connector and the lack of a stand or tripod. It requires users to supplement it with their own desktop stand and suspension support.

I have money! I need to add more money!

Here’s the translation:  “I recommend the Shur MV6 microphone. It comes with a companion app that supports automatic equalization (anti-shock sound). Sometimes it's useful, sometimes not so much, and it’s functionally similar to the previous Shanuz Q2U. The price is 1349 CNY.”

Here’s the translation:  **Opening Box Experience Video: [Simple Opening Soft MV6 Microphone - Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JoJqzBEyA)**

# What microphone are you using?

There are three Macs available to handle all my tasks comprehensively.

- Here’s a professional translation of the text:  “Mountain Sound Q2U: It was my primary microphone, and I recorded quite a few videos using him. However, due to the need for a suspender mount and a narrow recording range, I attempted to replicate a tongue-kissing effect – a technique that proved challenging with my lack of enthusiasm and the difficulty in utilizing the device.  I often used it during both singing and video recording.”

- The GreenLink USB Microphone - CM727 offers generally acceptable audio quality, with a price point under 200 CNY. The electret microphone boasts a wide dynamic range, making it suitable for everyday use where sound quality is less of a priority.

- The “K-Pop K-Pods SE” is a standard half-ear headphone with a capacitive earbud cover and a magnetic clasp. However, the product managers were incredibly clever – they’ve designed it to be hung discreetly below the lower lip, providing clear audio while allowing for easy movement. The only drawback is that I'm often lazy, and hanging the device on my lower lip creates a feeling of discomfort and can cause ear pain after prolonged use. It’s primarily used during singing sessions, with a price of 109 CNY (National Health Insurance reimbursement).

# The term “” in Chinese typically refers to a situation or problem that is difficult or problematic, often involving risk or potential disappointment. It suggests an unfavorable outcome or a challenging circumstance.

- Do not purchase microphones with a pop filter unless you have substantial financial resources and enjoy tinkering. If you buy a microphone with a port for a card, you’ll need to add several thousand in voice cards to it before you can fully monitor the audio. A basic unit costs around $1000, and once connected, you'll need to bring out a large-diaphragm condenser microphone and connect it to your computer, then adjust the audio levels using the equalizer, all of which takes time. If you have a capacitor microphone in a noisy environment, that’s a fortunate situation – recording for several hours can yield results, and after several hours of recording, you don't have the energy to continue. A standalone microphone with a USB microphone is sufficient.

- I consistently advise against purchasing an independent capacitor microphone; the more premium models demand a significantly enhanced recording environment, and investing one thousand dollars in a robust triangular capacitor microphone for environmental noise capture is a considerable undertaking.

- If you require a microphone for recording audio such as singing or video, ensure that the microphone you purchase supports hardware-level latency (that is, low latency).

- Do not purchase a 3.5mm microphone before buying a 3.5mm headphone, and then purchasing a pair of dual 3.5mm neural earbud adapters. It’s preferable to buy a single pair of earpads instead.

- Do not expect the microphone quality of gaming headphones to be exceptional, and I do not recommend purchasing them. A dynamic headphone with earpads typically costs under $500, and some gaming headphones start at over $1000.

- Don’t get carried away! Don’t create demand without a need. **Buying a thousand dollars worth of a microphone won't improve your vocal skills!**

- Don’t aim to consume every scenario. A cheap USB desktop microphone with noise cancellation is perfectly suitable for situations where you need to move around and chat with teammates during intense gameplay. Conversely, high-end dynamic microphones like the Shure MV6 are ideal for podcasts or singing – scenarios where you're not actively engaged for several hours. If you require full immersion, earpods can provide connectivity, but the microphone’s reception depends entirely on its placement; you wouldn’t want to constantly hold it in your mouth, just like with K-pop/KPods SE? It’s becoming increasingly monotonous.
