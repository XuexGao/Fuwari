title: "Recommendations for buying microphones"
description: "Over the past few years, a wide variety of headphones have been widely adopted – from thousands of Shure models to RODE, Glorious Sound, and even a handful of 100-unit half-ear models. Today, we’re summarizing common pitfalls and issues encountered with these devices."

# Okay, please provide the text you would like me to translate.

You are purchasing a microphone to do what? To communicate with friends more clearly and want to record voice, K-pop, record videos, or create podcasts.

# If you just want to chat with a friend over the phone.

If you’re using headphones with a wired remote control, you don’t need to buy a new microphone. You can use the NVIDIA Broadcast app or other noise-reducing software or services instead.

# Wanting to record music/K-pop/record videos/do a podcast.

The noise level of your recording environment – is it quiet? Are there air conditioning noises? Any background noise?

If your recording environment cannot be completely silent, then a **dynamic mixer** is an excellent choice.

The difference between an electrostatic capacitor (EC) and a rotary capacitor (RC) lies in their construction and function. An EC is a passive component that stores energy by accumulating charge when voltage is applied, while an RC is a passive component that stores energy through the principle of capacitance.

- Capacitor Microphone: Designed to capture all audio, including ambient noise, suitable for those seeking a more refined experience, and nearly every audio segment requires post-processing – but offers ample space for later refinement, particularly ideal for ASMR applications that amplify subtle movements and sounds.

- A significant portion of the sound from dynamic circles is composed of only mid-range frequencies, resulting in poor sensitivity to audio and minimal capture of environmental noise. When no post-processing is applied, the voice sounds exceptionally rich and full. Its key advantage is its focus on vocal recordings, but it’s crucial to maintain a distance of 5-30cm between the microphone and the subject to ensure optimal sound quality.

The Mountain Son Q2U dynamic microphone, I purchased it for 279 CNY at the time, now the market price is around 400 CNY.

The drawbacks of this microphone are its use of ancient Mini USB and lack of a stand, requiring users to supplement it with their own desktop stand and suspender.

I have money! I want to add money!

The Shul MV6 microphone features a companion app that supports automatic leveling (anti-shock sound). It’s similar to the previous Mountain Sound Q2U, with a price of 1349 CNY.

# Microphone?

There’s no single task that can be completed with just three machines.

- The mountain sound Q2U: Once was my only main microphone, and I recorded a lot of videos using him. However, because I needed to use a suspender and the recording range was too narrow, I had to record with a tongue-kissing technique and I wasn’t lazy enough to use it, sometimes when singing/recording, I used it.

- GreenLink USB Microphone-CM727: Audio quality is average, but the price is under 200 CNY. The electret microphone has a wide frequency response and is suitable for everyday use (I’m essentially past the point of needing great audio quality anymore).

- 全民K歌KPods SE：This is a standard half-ear+ capacitive earbud with a lip mount, but it’s thanks to product managers who are incredibly talented. They can hang the earbuds on the lower lip, which provides clear audio and allows for convenient movement. The only downside is that I'm too lazy, and I feel like wearing something on my lower lip gives an odd sensation, and if it’s too tight, it can cause pain in my ears when I sing, so it’s mainly used during singing. The price is 109 CNY (National Health Insurance).

# Okay, please provide the text. I’m ready when you are.

- Don’t buy a microphone with a pop filter unless you have a lot of cash and enjoy tinkering. If you buy a microphone with a port for capsules, you'll need to add several thousand in voice cards to it, all of which are already installed, and you still need to bring out a really big one to connect to your computer and then connect the microphone to your headphones. A set costs around $1000, and if the environment is noisy, you’re lucky. After recording for several hours, you can spend several hours tinkering with it, and eventually, you don't have the energy to do it. Buy an independent microphone and a USB microphone instead.

- I strongly advise against purchasing an independent microphone capsule, as these devices are increasingly expensive and can significantly degrade your recording environment. A 10,000-dollar audio triangle microphone set, purchased for environmental noise capture, will likely be a significant burden on your audio setup.

- If you need to record vocals or videos that require hardware-grade monitoring (with zero latency), ensure your microphone supports this type of setup.

- Don’t buy a 3.5mm microphone and then a 3.5mm headphone, and then buy a pair of dual 3.5mm neural earphones. It's better to just buy earbuds.

- The microphone quality of these gaming headphones is not exceptional, and I don’t recommend purchasing them. A dynamic microphone paired with earpods can cost under $500, and some gaming headphones start at over a thousand dollars.

- You don’t buy a thousand dollars worth of a microphone to improve your singing.

- A cheap USB desktop microphone with noise cancellation is perfect for situations where you need to move around and chat with teammates while playing games. For podcasts or singing, high-end dynamic microphones like the Shure MV6 are ideal for long periods of inactivity. If you need to consume a lot of audio, earpods can be used, but the microphone’s reception depends on its position – you can't just hold it in your mouth all the time, like with the All-in-One K-Pods SE. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to resist.
