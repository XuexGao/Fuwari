title: "Some Suggestions for Friends Who Want to Buy a Microphone"
description: "Over the past few years, I've tried various microphones, big and small. Whether it's thousands of dollars worth of Shure or RODE, hundreds of dollars worth of Shure, Green Alliance, or even 100-dollar budget models with half-in-ear mics, today I'm summarizing the pitfalls."

This article guides readers on choosing the right microphone based on their needs—whether for casual voice calls, singing, video recording, or podcasting. It recommends dynamic microphones like the Shure MV6 or Sennheiser Q2U for noisy environments, while cautioning against expensive condenser mics unless you have a controlled recording space. The author also shares personal gear, warns against complicated setups, and emphasizes that a good microphone won’t magically improve your vocal skills.

# Clarify your requirements

Why are you buying a microphone? Do you want clearer voice chats with friends? Do you want to record songs, karaoke, videos, or create podcasts?

# If you just want to voice call with friends

If you are using a headset with a line-controlled microphone, you do not need to purchase a new microphone—simply use [NVIDIA Broadcast App - AI-powered voice and video | NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.cn/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) or other noise-cancellation software/services instead.

# Want to record songs/Karaoke/video/make podcasts

This also involves your recording environment: is it quiet? Are there air conditioner noises? Construction noises? All sorts of miscellaneous noises?

If your recording environment cannot achieve absolute silence, then **dynamic microphone** is definitely the first choice.

> What is the difference between **condenser microphone** and **dynamic microphone**?

- Condenser Microphone: Captures everything, including ambient noise, suitable for those who need post-production, not ideal for lazy users. Almost every audio source requires post-production, but conversely, there is ample room for post-production, making it also very suitable for ASMR content that amplifies subtle sounds.

- Dynamic microphone: primarily captures mid-range vocals, has low sensitivity, and almost does not pick up ambient noise. Vocals sound rich even without any post-processing. Advantage: only captures vocals. Disadvantage: if too far away, audio quality suffers; recommended distance for recording: 5~30cm.

Recommendation: Shure Q2U dynamic microphone, I bought it for 279 CNY, now the market price is around 400 CNY.

The downside of this wheat is that it uses the ancient Mini USB, and the bare unit does not come with a stand, requiring users to purchase a desktop stand and an arm stand separately.

I have money! I want to add more money!

Okay, then I recommend the Shure MV6. This mic comes with a companion app that supports automatic gain (to prevent clipping, though it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't). Otherwise, it's basically the same as the above-mentioned Sennheiser Q2U, priced at 1349 CNY.

# What microphone am I currently using?

No microphone is capable of handling all tasks perfectly, so I have three mics on hand.

- Shure Q2U: It was once my only main microphone, and I used it to record many videos. However, because it requires a boom stand and has a very narrow pickup range, recording sound with it feels like kissing someone on the lips, and since I’m too lazy to use it, I sometimes use it when singing or recording videos.

- Green Union USB MIC-CM727: Average sound quality, but priced at less than 200 CNY. Condenser microphone, wide pickup range, suitable for everyday use (at this point, I hardly care about sound quality anymore).

- KaraOK KPods SE: Strictly speaking, this is a standard semi-in-ear design with a condenser lavalier mic, but thanks to the product manager’s genius, you can hang the mic under your lower lip, which ensures clear audio while allowing you to move freely. The only downside is that I’m too lazy to wear it—there’s a foreign-body sensation when something hangs under my lower lip, and if it’s too tight, my ears will hurt by the end of the day. So I usually only use it while singing. Price: 109 CNY (with national subsidy).

# Pitfall

- Don't buy microphones that require an audio interface unless you're rich and enjoy tinkering. If you purchase a XLR microphone, you'll need to buy a thousand-yuan audio interface separately. By this point, wouldn't you also need a monitoring headphone? Altogether, that's over ten thousand yuan. Then, when you want to use it, you have to first plug in the expensive audio interface into your computer, connect the microphone and monitoring headphones, and finally open your computer's equalizer to adjust various settings before you can start recording. And if you happen to buy a condenser mic in a noisy environment, you're in for a treat—spend several hours recording, then another several hours on post-production. Honestly, I don't have the energy for that. Just buy a USB microphone for an independent microphone.

- I never recommend buying an isolated condenser microphone; the more expensive it is, the more it demands a pristine recording environment. If you buy a high-end Audio-Technica condenser mic for ten thousand yuan and it records environmental noise with crystal clarity, can you handle it?

- If you need to record songs/videos or any scenario requiring monitoring, please ensure the microphone you buy supports hardware-level monitoring (with zero latency).

- Don't buy a 3.5mm microphone first, then a 3.5mm headphone, and then a dual 3.5mm neural audio adapter to connect them. It's better to just buy a single pair of Earpods.

- Don't expect the microphone quality of gaming headsets to be very good, and I also don't recommend purchasing gaming headsets. A dynamic mic plus Earpods costs less than 500 yuan, while some gaming headsets start at over a thousand yuan.

- Don't get carried away! Don't get carried away! Don't get carried away! Don't create demand where there is none! **Buying a thousand-yuan microphone will not improve your singing skills!**

- Don’t expect one mic to handle all scenarios. A cheap USB desktop mic (with noise reduction) is suitable for gaming situations where you’re moving around and chatting with teammates. Meanwhile, high-end dynamic mics like the Shure MV6 are better suited for podcasting or singing scenarios where you stay still for hours. If you insist on something that works universally, Earpods can technically do that—but the microphone quality of wired earphones entirely depends on where you place them; you can’t always keep them right on your mouth, like the KPods SE from Quanmin Karaoke, right? It’s also possible, I guess—I’m just getting lazier.
