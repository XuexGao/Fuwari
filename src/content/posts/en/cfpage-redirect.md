# Quickly get started!

I am forwarding my [仓库](https://github.com/afoim/Redirect_Group) to you.

Follow up the repository to Cloudflare deployment worker or page, and then bind your domain.

Please provide the text you would like me to translate. I need the content to be translated.

Okay, I understand. Please provide the text.

```bash
/ https://www.afo.im/ 301
/test/* https://test.test/test/:splat 302
```

Please provide the text you would like me to translate.

Access `/` 301 permanently redirects to `https://www.afo.im/`.

Access temporary redirects to [https://test.test/test/](https://test.test/test/).

Absolutely! Here’s the translation:  “It is exceptionally powerful and does not consume excessive worker requests.”
