# Character illustration turned into live-action cosplay

> Generate a highly detailed photo of
> 
> a girl cosplaying this illustration, at Comiket.
> 
> Exactly replicate the same pose, body posture,
> 
> hand gestures, facial expressions, and camera
> 
> framing as in the original illustration. Keep the
> 
> same angle, perspective, and composition,
> 
> without any deviation

Note:

- The character illustration should preferably have a solid-colored background, with the main character fully intact.

- In the character illustrations, the characters should not perform actions that are impossible in reality, as this may trigger the AI's Copy function, causing the image to be copied entirely rather than generating a Cosplayer.

# Qixi Grass Sketch

> A photorealistic scene inside a McDonald’s restaurant.
> 
> On my table, there is a picture frame showing the anime-style image I provided.
> 
> Everything outside the frame must be 100% realistic and human.
> 
> On the opposite table, a real Chinese couple is sitting together.
> 
> The female partner is cosplaying the character from the provided image, wearing the same outfit, but she must look like a real human girl, not a drawing or cartoon.
> 
> ⚠️ She should not mimic the exact pose or gesture from the anime illustration — instead, she should be doing something natural for a restaurant setting, such as eating food, drinking from a cup, talking with her partner, or smiling casually.
> 
> The entire environment (restaurant interior, people, cosplay) must look like a natural camera photo.
> 
> Apply background blur (bokeh effect) to the opposite table and everything behind it, making the image look like it was taken with a DSLR camera, not generated.
> 
> Only the picture inside the frame can contain anime style; all other elements must be realistic.

# Conclusion

- It is best to use English prompts.

- You can first describe to a general-purpose large model (such as ChatGPT) what image you want to draw, and then have it return an English prompt.

- Good images are not achieved overnight; they require careful refinement.
