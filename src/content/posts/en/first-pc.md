# Previous Context
I know everyone is here to listen to my experience and thoughts about my first manual assembly of a desktop computer, but please allow me to first recount what happened before this, which will explain why I mentioned in the article's introduction that **I happened to get an opportunity by chance** and also why it was **an unavoidable part of the experience**.

Let us rewind the timeline to when I still owned the **X**. Although earlier articles roughly covered this, I sold the Aurora X to buy a Mac—but that’s all there was to it. In reality, this was merely a mediocre beginning.

So first, because I got heated up playing **Karabaq** with my friends, I felt **I have never felt this happy while playing games before** that day, and thus decided to sell my Windows laptop, the Aurora X, and buy a MacBook to focus on productivity (hard to handle).

I have very strong, and on the first day I went to **** to sell my Aurora X, then immediately ordered a MacBook Air from 2025, which is the one mentioned in the previous few articles **Mac**

Next, after using it for a few days, the Mac truly lives up to its reputation. As long as you're using it for work, the M4 + macOS becomes a seamless powerhouse—superb processor performance combined with a highly unified workflow. Whether you're editing videos, retouching photos, designing posters, coding websites, or modifying code, as long as it's productivity-related, the Mac handles it effortlessly.

But as the old saying goes, ****. It's unrealistic and too oppressive for a person to spend 16 hours a day working, excluding 8 hours of sleep. So on the second day after I got my Mac, I started researching how to play **GalGame**. As for why I didn't research how to play ****, it's because the red-hot state was still ongoing at the time, and secondly, I already knew that running Windows programs on macOS still relies on Wine. Although Wine has developed for many years, it still can't get past the **** hurdle for competitive games. So I didn't bother trying to play on Mac, and besides, layered emulation not only consumes performance but also increases power consumption. If I really wanted to play games, why wouldn't I just use Windows?

The seed of doubt has already taken root and grown in my heart; all that’s needed is one spark to completely burn away my **apple dream**. That spark is: **about how I bought a Mac but didn’t buy a DP-to-C cable, leaving me unable to use macOS on my monitor, and since I also didn’t buy a C-port hub, my mouse and keyboard are unusable—so am I doomed to use only the trackpad and butterfly keyboard for the rest of my life? Adadad, how can this be?**. If you’ve understood the bolded text above, you might wonder, hey, why not just try buying a DP-to-C cable? (Actually, I did buy one later.) Why not try buying a hub? That’s because

I always consider things with the bigger picture in mind. When I reached the conclusion that the Mac would not be able to accompany me for a long time, abandoning the Mac was simply a matter of time.

Then, logically, I sold the Mac on **Love Recycling** (because the quote was 300 more). When the quality inspector asked me how many days I had used it, I said five days, and he was stunned. I said: **Oh, Windows is still better; I really can't figure out macOS**, and he immediately agreed: **Yes, yes, that's right**.

In short, regardless of the process, I no longer have a computer that works now, so the next step is definitely to rush and get another computer.

Maybe I was in a hurry and accidentally discovered JD's flash sale feature, then accidentally paid a thousand yuan more for a **Alienware 11 Ryzen Edition**. Flash sales really are flash—delivered within less than half an hour.

Turned it on immediately, wow! Still has that authentic Windows feel!

But good times didn’t last long. Perhaps because I had some lingering doubts about AMD machines, plus this junk machine blue-screened three times and showed screen distortion twice on the very day I received it, and its gaming frame rate wasn’t very stable (though I later manually adjusted it to be more stable). This led me to have a new idea: **Laptops are a waste of money; at the same price, desktops still offer better performance!**

You don’t need me to say it—you’ve probably already guessed it. Right! Another 5 days later, I sold the **Shadow Elf 11 Ryzen Edition** on **ZhuanZhuan**. When the quality inspection guy asked me again how many days I’d had the device, I said 5 days, and he froze, then said: **This is still within my testing period**. Less than ten minutes later, I received the payment.

Alright, then the second cycle has ended, and I’m still in a situation where I can’t use a computer (though it’s not exactly a necessity). However, this time, I’ve made up my mind: **I absolutely have to try playing with a desktop computer!**

Fortunately, my friend was about to upgrade his CPU and, coincidentally, was switching from Intel to AMD, meaning his motherboard and CPU were going to be idle. He asked me if I wanted them, and of course, I jumped at the chance. I smoothly acquired the board and CPU. From there, I only needed to purchase a graphics card, RAM, hard drive, power supply, cooling system, and case — since the board and CPU wouldn’t cost me anything, my budget was extremely generous. Also, because I’m impatient, I opted for **JD Same-Day Delivery**, which means items shipped from local warehouses — possibly adding a few hundred yuan, but it was worth it to cure my “impatience.” However, the board and CPU originally were supposed to be shipped by air, but customs inspection failed, so they switched to land transport. Unfortunately, land transport doesn’t support same-day delivery — meaning even if my other components arrive the same day, the board and CPU won’t, and the extra money I paid for same-day delivery would be wasted. But hey, it’s already done — so I’ll just roll with it. Below is my configuration list.

Then the effect after installation is shown in the figure.

# PC Assembly Tutorial

Because I’ve never assembled a computer myself in my life, but since I’m a tech person, I figured this shouldn’t be too difficult. Plus, there are many assembly tutorial videos available today, such as https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BG4y137mG — I followed it step by step. Since the components are all DIY, some steps might not match perfectly, and sometimes the manuals say something won’t work, but in reality, it might still work. You’ll have to try it yourself to see what actually works.

# PC building pitfalls

RAM module. The motherboard shown in the video has dual-side retention clips, but my motherboard only has clips on one side, so I fiddled with the other side for a while without any result until I realized there were no clips there (I'm such a dumbass).

Water cooling. Nowadays, building a PC isn't just about getting it to **run**—it's also about aesthetics and **R！G！B！**. However, this water cooler comes with three RGB wires, but the motherboard only has one RGB header. I heard it's meant for **God Light Sync**, but since the package doesn't include a hub, I won't connect it. After all, for me, **R！G！B！** just adds unnecessary power consumption (though these little lights do look pretty cool).

Thermal paste. Most heatsinks come with some thermal paste included, so you don't need to buy it separately.

Case. Since there are many contact points on the back of the motherboard, direct contact with the case might cause a short circuit. Therefore, most cases have screw holes inside where you can install screw posts to clamp and secure the motherboard. The problem lies with these screw posts—they are hexagonal posts, but **do not come with hex wrenches or socket adapters**. That means, unless you have a pair of pliers at home, you won’t be able to install these posts, unless you’re the Hulk.

The case manual states that it supports a 240mm front-mounted radiator. It does support it, but the graphics card blocks it. Because I trusted the manual too much, I went ahead and ordered a air cooler on **JD Flash Sale**, for **250** yuan. The seller even called me to confirm my motherboard model—maybe something unspeakable happened in the past * In any case, right after the air cooler arrived, a group friend reminded me that I could mount the radiator on top. I tried it out, and it works perfectly—this is the manual that came with the case!
