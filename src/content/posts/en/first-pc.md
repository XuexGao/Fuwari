description: "Early on, I considered installing a desktop computer in my home. Fortunately, an opportunity arose through chance, and I’ve designated it as “an unexpected encounter.”  The reason for this designation is reflected in the VCR footage."

# Please provide the text! I need the text to translate.
I wanted to share my initial thoughts and feelings about assembling a desktop computer, but I’ll start by telling you about something that happened before. This will explain why I’m introducing this article with the title “阴差阳错的获得了一个机会” (literally "A fortunate opportunity gained through chance"). It's also a necessary step in my journey.

We started to move the timeline back to the time when I still held onto **Polar Aurora X Notebook** and then, although we had covered the basics in previous articles, I only stopped there. In reality, this was merely a mediocre beginning.

那么首先，因为我和朋友打 **卡拉彼丘** 红温了，那天就觉得 **我从来没有觉得打游戏开心过** ，于是便决定将手上的Windows笔记本，也就是极光X卖掉，然后买一个MacBook专注生产力（难绷）

He is very energetic and immediately sold a polar bear (a rare type of aurora) the first day, then immediately placed an order for a 25-year MacBook Air, which was mentioned in previous articles as his reason for buying one.

Mac is truly Mac, and with you handling the work, the M4+ macOS will be a match for gods – boasting unparalleled processor performance and a unified workflow. Whether it’s video editing, photo retouching, graphic design, web development, or coding, it's effortless to handle.

However, the saying goes, “But it’s true that good things are fleeting.” People cannot work 24 hours a day without sleeping for 8 hours and 16 hours, which is unrealistic. So, I started researching how to play this thing on Mac as soon as I got my MacBook. As to why I didn't want to research how to play it, firstly, the red-hot state of the game was still ongoing, and secondly, I already knew that using Wine on macOS was the way to run Windows programs. Although Wine has been around for so long, it’s not able to compete with gaming games **反作弊**. So, I didn't think about playing on Mac, and furthermore, layer-by-layer translation consumes performance and adds power consumption. If I were to play a game, why wouldn’t I use Windows instead?

The seeds of doubt have already taken root within my heart, so all that’s needed is a single flame to completely extinguish my **apple dream**. That fire is: [[B:about buying a Mac but not buying a DP to C port, resulting in me being unable to use macOS simultaneously because I don't have a C port expansion坞 and my mouse and keyboard won't work. Is this really the case? Why don’t you try buying a DP to C port cable instead? (Actually, it was bought) Why not try buying an expansion坞 instead? Because…

He considers everything from a strategic perspective, and when he concludes that Mac will not be able to accompany him for a long time, abandoning it is simply a matter of time.

而后，顺理成章的在 **爱回收** （因为报价多300）把Mac卖了，质检小哥问我用了几天的时候，我说5天，他愣住了，我说： **哎，还是Windows好用，macOS真用不明白** ，随后他也附和道： **是的是的**

I’m currently unable to use a computer, so the next step is to quickly get back to it.

The flash sale at 京东 is very exciting! I accidentally overpaid for an AMD Ryzen 9 11-series Intel laptop, and it arrived within about 30 minutes.

Upon immediate startup, it’s truly Windows!

But good times don’t last, it may be because I had a shadow of AMD machines before, and adding this broken machine to my hands that day resulted in three blue screens and two screen freezes. This led to the emergence of a new idea: **laptops are a tax on intelligence, performance gains depend on desktop machines!**

Five days after that, I sold my Ryzen 7 14000X in Turnals. When the quality control officer asked again about how long I’d purchased it, he was stunned, and then said: “I’ve already accounted for this.” Within less than a minute, I received payment.

Absolutely! Here’s the translation of the text:  “The second round is over, and I'm still in a situation without a computer (though not urgently needed). However, this time, I made a firm commitment: **Let's play everything on the desktop!**”

恰巧，朋友准备换CPU了，又恰巧，要从Intel换成AMD，也就是说，他的主板和U都闲置了，就问我要不要。那我肯定是求之不得，然后便顺理成章的拿到了板U，接下来只需要自己买显卡内存硬盘电源散热机箱即可，因为板U暂时不需要我掏钱了，所以预算非常充足，又因为我这个人心急吧，于是便找了 **京东当日达** 也就是本地仓发货的，可能要加个几百块，但是刚好可以治我的“心急病”，但是吧，朋友的板U本来是走飞机的，但是安检没过，所以转陆运了，那么陆运就不能当日达了，也就是说就算我的其他配件当日达，板U不能当日达那我这加的钱就是白加，不过算了，既来之则安之，那么以下是我的配置单

“After installing, the effects appear as shown in the image.”

# Here’s a guide to setting up your device.

Because I’ve lived this big for so long, I never had the opportunity to install anything myself. However, I believe it should be quite easy since I’m working in a technical field, and with so many tutorial videos online like https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BG4y137mG. I just follow along step-by-step, as some steps might not work, and some instructions say it's not possible but can be tried out on my own.

# Trouble-shooting for PC enthusiasts.

Memory card. The mainboard’s memory card slot is double-sided, but this motherboard only has a single-rail version, so after half an hour of trying without any response, I discovered that the other side was not locked (I'm an idiot).

Water cooling. Now it’s not just about him being able to **run**, but also about aesthetics and **R!G!B!**. However, this water cooling has three RGB lines, but only one RGB interface on the motherboard, which is supposed to be for **synchronize god light** , but since you didn’t bring in a header, I won’t connect it. For me, **R!G!B!** is just adding power consumption (though those little lights are actually quite pretty).

Silicone. Most cooling fans typically include silicone sealant. It’s not necessary to purchase it separately.

The chassis has many contact points on the back, and directly touching it could cause short circuits. Therefore, most of the internal chassis have screw holes for attaching a screw bracket, then securing the motherboard within the bracket. The issue lies with this screw bracket itself – it’s a six-sided hexagonal screw bracket, but **it does not include a screw nut** meaning you shouldn't attempt to install one unless you are a green giant.

**Device Manual**  The manual indicates support for a front-mounted 240mm liquid cooler, and it is indeed supported. However, the graphics card blocked it due to my reliance on the manual. I subsequently purchased a fan cooler, costing 250 yuan, and the retailer contacted me to confirm my motherboard model. It appears there may have been an incident involving this previously.  Once the fan cooler arrived, I was alerted that it could be installed in the top case, and I tested it successfully – as per the instructions!
