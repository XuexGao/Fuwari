title: "First Self-Built Desktop! Keyboard and Monitor Must Be On!"
description: "I began considering installing a desktop computer at home several years ago. However, by chance, I was fortunate enough to receive an opportunity this time around. As for why I’ve labeled it “shadowy” and “chance,” consider it a result of VCR viewing."

# Here’s the translation:  Press release summary.
I understand that many of you are interested in hearing about my first attempt at building a desktop computer. I’ve been reflecting on the process, and I want to share some of my thoughts and feelings regarding this experience. However, before I delve into the details, I would like to briefly explain the context behind this introduction – it's **a chance encounter that led to an opportunity**. Simultaneously, it also represents a significant part of what has been required for me.

Let’s revisit the timeline, specifically when I was holding onto the **Polaris X Notebook** – while we covered the initial sections of previous articles, I subsequently sold it for a Mac, but that's where the story ends. In reality, this represents merely a modest beginning.

那么首先，因为我和朋友打 **卡拉彼丘** 红温了，那天就觉得 **我从来没有觉得打游戏开心过** ，于是便决定将手上的Windows笔记本，也就是极光X卖掉，然后买一个MacBook专注生产力（难绷）

I am highly productive, and I immediately sold a polar bear (a rare type of aurora) on my first day. Subsequently, I placed an order for a 25-year-old MacBook Air, which aligns with the points discussed in previous articles regarding my purchase of a Mac.

Here’s a professional translation:  “After several days of dedicated use, Mac truly lives up to its reputation – it is exceptionally powerful and efficient. The M4+ macOS configuration offers unparalleled performance for any task, from video editing and graphic design to web development and coding. Regardless of the specific application, Mac consistently demonstrates exceptional proficiency and ease of use.”

However, the saying goes, “The old adage is that ****.” People cannot work 24 hours a day, removing sleep for 8 hours, 16 hours, without it being realistic. Therefore, I began researching how to play **GalGame** on my Mac within the first day of my purchase. As for why I didn’t delve into the intricacies of ****’s gameplay, it was because the red-hot state of Windows programs on macOS was still ongoing, and I already knew that Wine would be the standard solution for running Windows applications on macOS. However, despite its extensive development over many years, Wine couldn't overcome the anti-cheat challenge in **** – so I didn’t intend to play games on Mac at all. Furthermore, layering translation not only consumes performance but also increases power consumption; if I were to actually play games, why would I use Windows instead?

The seeds of doubt have already taken root within me, and they are beginning to sprout. With just a spark, I can completely extinguish my **Apple Dreams**. That fire is simply: **About buying a Mac but not purchasing a DP to C port, resulting in the inability to use macOS on the display; also, the mouse and keyboard functionality of my computer are unusable due to this lack. Is this truly the case for my life?**; Furthermore, if you understand the highlighted text, you might wonder why one shouldn’t try purchasing a DP to C port instead? (Actually, I did.) Why not try purchasing an expansion enclosure instead? Because…

I approach every situation with a focus on the overall picture, and when I conclude that Mac may not be able to remain with me for an extended period, abandoning it is simply a matter of time.

而后，顺理成章的在 **爱回收** （因为报价多300）把Mac卖了，质检小哥问我用了几天的时候，我说5天，他愣住了，我说： **哎，还是Windows好用，macOS真用不明白** ，随后他也附和道： **是的是的**

Ultimately, with the process unfolding as it has, I am currently unable to utilize a computer. Therefore, the next step must be to expedite the return of the entire system.

Here’s the translation:  “It seems I stumbled upon a flash sale on JD, accidentally overpaying for a **Dark Shadow 11 Ryzen Edition** – it was incredibly attractive! It arrived within about an hour.”

Upon activation, it’s immediately apparent that it’s Windows!

Despite the good times being fleeting, it likely stems from a previous shadow of concern regarding AMD hardware, compounded by the fact that this machine arrived shortly after experiencing three blue screens and two screen freezes. This has prompted a new idea: **laptops are essentially a tax on intelligence, and performance gains depend heavily on desktop machines!**

I’ve already revealed it. It’s true – five days after that, I took the **11** to ****. When the quality control officer asked again about my machine's purchase date, he was stunned and replied, “I’ve already accounted for this.” Within a few minutes, I received payment.

**Must experience everything on a full desktop!**

恰巧，朋友准备换CPU了，又恰巧，要从Intel换成AMD，也就是说，他的主板和U都闲置了，就问我要不要。那我肯定是求之不得，然后便顺理成章的拿到了板U，接下来只需要自己买显卡内存硬盘电源散热机箱即可，因为板U暂时不需要我掏钱了，所以预算非常充足，又因为我这个人心急吧，于是便找了 **京东当日达** 也就是本地仓发货的，可能要加个几百块，但是刚好可以治我的“心急病”，但是吧，朋友的板U本来是走飞机的，但是安检没过，所以转陆运了，那么陆运就不能当日达了，也就是说就算我的其他配件当日达，板U不能当日达那我这加的钱就是白加，不过算了，既来之则安之，那么以下是我的配置单

Following the setup, the results are as follows.

# Machine Operation Guide

Due to my extensive lifespan, I have never attempted to install any technology myself. However, considering my technical background, I believe it should be relatively straightforward. Furthermore, numerous tutorial videos demonstrating the process are available on platforms like Bilibili ([https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BG4y137mG](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BG4y137mG)). I’ve followed these step-by-step guides, acknowledging that some aspects may not work perfectly and requiring experimentation to determine their viability.

# This refers to a process of troubleshooting or diagnosing technical issues, often involving complex and potentially frustrating procedures. It implies a need for careful investigation and problem-solving.

The memory card slot on the motherboard is dual-pin, but this motherboard only has a single-pin version for the slot. After attempting to force it down for half an hour without any response, I discovered that the other side was not engaging with the slot (I’m a fool!).

Water cooling is no longer just about enabling him to run, it’s also about aesthetics and visual appeal – a significant upgrade. However, this water cooler boasts three RGB connections, but only one dedicated RGB interface on the motherboard. It's intended for a “God Light Sync” configuration, but since the packaging doesn’t include a header, I won’t be connecting it. For me, however, this small light is genuinely pleasing to the eye.

Silicone is often supplied with cooling systems to help dissipate heat. It’s typically not purchased separately.

The chassis has numerous connectors on the back panel, and directly contacting it could lead to short circuits. Therefore, most chassis interiors feature screw holes for securing a mounting plate, which then firmly attaches the motherboard. The issue lies with this mounting plate itself – it’s a hexagonal screw-in plate, but **no supplied screw-in sleeve** meaning that if you don't have a screwdriver set, you shouldn’t attempt to install it; unless you are a green giant.

Here’s the translation:  **Device Manual**  The manual indicates support for a front-mounted 240mm liquid cooler. It is indeed supported, however, the graphics card blocked it due to my reliance on the instructions. I subsequently purchased a fan cooler, costing 250 RMB, and the retailer contacted me to verify my motherboard model. There was once an incident that may have been concerning.  Upon installation, the fan cooler worked as described in the manual!

# Performance testing.

First, this is the final configuration for the aircraft.
