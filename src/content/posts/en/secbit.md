Secbit provides better performance for mainland China direct connections than Cloudflare, offering lower latency and higher bandwidth. The main drawback is its high cost, but users can apply for access by writing blogs and reaching 3,000 monthly IPs to join a community group.

# Summary

Secbit is more friendly toward direct connections from mainland China compared to Cloudflare, offering lower latency and greater bandwidth. The only downside is that purchasing directly is expensive. I also recommend everyone write more blogs, **When your website's monthly IP count reaches 3k, check the pinned article for group joining instructions—I’ll help you apply.** Let’s all strive to get our own Secbit soon 😋
